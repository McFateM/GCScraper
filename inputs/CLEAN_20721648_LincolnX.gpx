      When texting became popular, I told myself I would never do it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Now I text all the time, its a convenience thing, no more lengthy phone calls, you can get everything you need done via a text.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The answers to these puzzles, are U.S. States and Capitals.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Solve the puzzles, and get the coordinates to the cache.&lt;br /&gt;

        Day 3 of a three-day roadie road trip to Lincoln, NE with the Photo Chicks -- javthrowr and ksumom2004. Today is the three-year anniversary of my only child's death, and I wanted to be with friends doing what I love the most today and in the days leading up to it.  javthrowr solved the puzzle, and while she and ksumom2004 debated about where the cache might be, I got out of the Jeep, found the cache immediately, and signed the log.  [:D]  TFTC and the fun.

        The last person thought this was lonely when it hadn't been found in 8 months...  But I just found it tonight after it hadn't been found in 17 months!  Cache was in perfect condition!  Thanks for the fun puzzle!  I was super impressed with myself for actually solving it!  I usually avoid puzzles like the plague, but I think I need to venture out of my comfort zone a bit.  Thanks so much for bringing me here!  Glad I chose this time of year to search for it!  I would not have wanted to do this in the summer!  Would've been too many bugs!  Eww!  Haha!  Thanks again!  Keeping my streak alive, one day at a time!  :)

        In town for pre-MOGA event. We are a group of five: kevins2betsey, roy&amp;annette and peachy1276. Logs are signed TJC.  today we are focusing on mysteries solved, non-traditionals and/or high favorite  points.  We were confused because we had solved it before we got here but weren't coming up with a find. Another cacher drove by and stopped to offer a hint that sent us you the right location. Log is damp but signable.

      &lt;p&gt;History of Mass Transit system - (from wikipedia)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Conveyances for public hire are as old as the first ferries, and the earliest public transport was water transport: on land people walked (sometimes in groups and on pilgrimages, as noted in sources such as the Bible and Canterbury Tales) or (at least in the Old World) rode an animal.&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt; Ferries are part of Greek mythology – corpses in ancient Greece were buried with a coin underneath their tongue to pay the ferryman Charon to take them to Hades&lt;sup&gt;[&lt;em&gt;citation needed&lt;/em&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
Some historical forms of public transport are the stagecoach, traveling a fixed route from coaching inn to coaching inn, and the horse-drawn boat carrying paying passengers, which was a feature of European canals from their 17th-century origins. (The canal itself is a form of infrastructure dating back to antiquity – it was used at least for freight transportation in ancient Egypt to bypass the Aswan cataract – and the Chinese also built canals for transportation as far back as the Warring States period.&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt; Whether or not those canals were used for for-hire public transport is unknown; the Grand Canal was primarily used for shipping grain.)&lt;br /&gt;
The omnibus, the first organized public transit system within a city, appears to have originated in Paris, France, in 1662,&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt; although the service in question failed a few months after its founder died; omnibuses are next known to have appeared in Nantes, France, in 1826. The omnibus was introduced to London in July 1829.&lt;sup&gt;[5]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The first passenger horse-drawn railway was opened in 1806 between Swansea and Mumbles in South Wales, United Kingdom.&lt;sup&gt;[6]&lt;/sup&gt; In 1825, George Stephenson built the &lt;em&gt;Locomotion&lt;/em&gt; for the Stockton and Darlington Railway, north east England, which was the first public steam railway in the world.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Different Modes of Mass Transit include: Airline, Bus and Coach, Train, Commuter, Intercity, high speed rail, tram and light rail, rapid transit, personal rapid transit, cable-propelled transit, ferry, motorcycle, and pedicab. This is just a few examples of the different types of mass transit.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Now that you have learned about Mass Transit, its time to go find the cache!&lt;br /&gt;

      The location of this cache is the site of a recent Boy Scout Eagle project that was organized and completed in 2003 by Ryan in Troop 49.  His project involved placing two benches along the trail here at the Lincoln Saline Wetlands Nature Center.  Numerous service hours were logged by members of Troop 49 and others to complete this project.

      Reaching the rank of Eagle Scout in the Boy Scouts of America requires years of dedication and hard work. In addition to 21 required merit badges, each Scout must complete a project that — on average — requires 167 service hours. In 2008 alone, that translated to $16 million in service (based on the national volunteer hour value of $19.51). This cache is part of a nationwide geocaching series called “Cache to Eagle” that showcases these special contributions. 
Over its first 100 years, Scouting has provided millions of hours of service to communities across America. For our 100th Anniversary, we’re celebrating that legacy with special service opportunities through “A Year of Celebration, A Century of Making a Difference.” You can join us, and even earn a commemorative patch! Visit Scouting.org/100years to learn more.

We’ve hidden twelve caches to showcase Eagle Scout projects in each of the districts in the Cornhusker Council. Three are in the Prairie Winds District, three are in the Seven Feathers District, and six are in the Salt Valley District (this is one of them). Find all 12!

Search for “Cornhusker Council, Cache to Eagle”. Collect the keywords in all 12 caches in order to locate the final mystery cache containing special Cache to Eagle patches!

I'd just found the nearby EarthCache, then when I got back to my geo-vehicle, I noticed that this Multi was very near. I went to the first waypoint, projected the final location, then spent several minutes looking for the cache container. It was in a nice hiding spot - I missed it at first.
The log (with "NEW LOG" written at the top) was wet, but I managed to make my entry on it. Unfortunately, I couldn't see any sign of the "keyword" in or on the cache container. But since I see that at least one of the caches in the series (#8) was archived years ago, I guess the "final mystery cache" hasn't been findable for quite a while. Oh, well - always glad to get another Multi anyway.

---
Today was day 5 of a 9 day road trip with mrs. qbee to Nebraska (where I'm sponsoring an event [The Big Yellow One's the Sun](https://coord.info/GC7620X) ) and then back home.  We mapped out a somewhat less than optimal route that allowed us to see some really cool places, both urban and incredibly remote.

Today we covered 178.6 miles and collected 12 [:)] and 0 [:(] for the day.  Unless otherwise noted, all finds were in good condition.  Thanks to the COs for their efforts and for bringing us out to some great places.  This was [:)] #7172 for me.

      &lt;p&gt;Night Caches have been designed to be found at night. They can be difficult or impossible  to find during the day.  For example, you must use a flashlight and follow a series of reflectors to find the final location. Night caches usually have the attribute "night cache", "recommended at night", and/or "flashlight required." UV caches are a variation on night caches, where cachers seeking the cache will need to use a UV flashlight. Cache owners of UV caches must include the UV attribute on the cache page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://support.groundspeak.com/index.php?pg=file&amp;amp;from=2&amp;amp;id=133" /&gt; &lt;img src="https://support.groundspeak.com/index.php?pg=file&amp;amp;from=2&amp;amp;id=33" /&gt; &lt;img src="https://support.groundspeak.com/index.php?pg=file&amp;amp;from=2&amp;amp;id=34" /&gt; &lt;img src="https://support.groundspeak.com/index.php?pg=file&amp;amp;from=2&amp;amp;id=168" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Night caches are most often listed as mystery caches, sometimes as multi-caches. The starting coordinates often locate the first of the reflector/UV mark location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who use Pocket Queries (a Premium Member feature), can create a filter using the attributes above, and automate their searches.&lt;/p&gt;
When designing a night cache, please keep in mind that the hunt for a cache &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; include GPS use to a set of accurate coordinates. The location of the container with log must be loaded into the waypoints tool.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are not alot of night caches in the area, but they are something I thoroughly enjoy!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is a series of caches all being letterboxes, none of the hides are tough, just look in the obvious locations. Some of the micro sized containers, do not contain an ink pad, so please bring your own if you choose to stamp. Do not take the stamp or ink pad, they must stay in the container.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;

      Nice walk through the park, in the end you will be looking for a cache, larger then a bison tube, smaller then a normal sized lock n lock.
     </groundspeak:short_description>
     <groundspeak:long_description html="True">
      The coordinates will take you to the parking lot.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
From here, take a look around, you should see approximately a dozen light posts. Go to each one of them, and get the numbers off of them. These should be very obvious, keep track of these numbers, and add them all together.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Step 2 - Go to N 40 49.777 and W 096 42.936, here you should see a rock with some information about the salt basin. Here you need to retreive two sets of numbers, the first set equals ABCD, and the second set equals EFGH.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Step 3 - Go to N 40 49.791 and W 096 42.931, here you will find a smaller rock with a plaque on it, there is a 4 digit number here as well, these numbers will be IJKL.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Step 4 - Go to N 40 49.803 and W 096 42.923, here you will find a plaque up high, read this plaque and find the 4 digit number, this number equals MNOP.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Now that you have visited all of the locations, its time to do some simple math to figure out the coords to the final cache location.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
(K-G) (E-M) (A+E+I+M) N . D F (D-P)&lt;br /&gt;
L J C (P+M) (B-O+A) . (K+H) I B&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You can forget about the number from all the light posts, that's me just making you do some extra walking around the park!&lt;br /&gt;

        We were planning to stay overnight in Lincoln on a big road trip with my mom to Wyoming and saw there were puzzles nearby so we had to try to solve some.  Fortunately we were able to solve this one fairly quickly.  The tool to verify coordinates wasn't working and we always like to confirm our solution, but since the puzzle was straightforward we were somewhat confident in our coordinates.  It was getting late so we only had time for 1 find tonight and found this one quickly.  It was in the second place I looked.  Thanks fpr the fun puzzle cache,  TFTC

      &lt;span style="background-color:white;color:red;"&gt;Welcome to Letter Box Lake!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style="color:rgb(153, 51, 153);"&gt;What is Letterboxing?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style="color:rgb(51, 204, 255);"&gt;Check out this Geocaching Vlogger video on Letterboxing!  &lt;br /&gt;
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT3WXhyaOK8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br style="color:rgb(51, 204, 255);" /&gt;
&lt;span style="color:rgb(51, 204, 255);"&gt;Letterboxing is an intriguing “treasure hunt” style outdoor activity. Letterboxers hide small, weatherproof boxes in publicly-accessible places (like parks) and post clues to finding the box online on one of several Web sites. However, clues to finding some of the most highly-sought boxes are passed around by word of mouth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br style="color:rgb(51, 204, 255);" /&gt;
&lt;span style="color:rgb(51, 204, 255);"&gt;There are about 90,000 active letterboxes hidden in North America alone. Individual letterboxes usually contain a log book, an often hand-carved rubber stamp and occasionally contain an ink pad. Finders make an imprint of the letterbox’s stamp on their personal log book, and leave an imprint of their personal stamp on the letterbox’s logbook.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

In a lifetime, you are more likely to die from fireworks or lightning. Whereas over 100 million sharks are killed every year by humans.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="border:0px none ;margin:12px 0px 0px;padding:0px;font-style:inherit;font-variant:inherit;font-weight:inherit;font-stretch:inherit;font-size:inherit;line-height:inherit;font-family:inherit;vertical-align:baseline;"&gt;Sharks are killed by the millions annually to supply demand for their fins, which are made into soup and eaten as a status symbol. Such demand for fins has led to overfishing and illegal fishing, depleting shark populations worldwide. Conservationists dedicate their lives to protecting animals like sharks. Send them a thank-you note for protecting species being illegally killed. &lt;a href="https://www.dosomething.org/campaigns/wildlife-cards?source=node/4680" style="border:0px none ;margin:0px;padding:0px;font-style:inherit;font-variant:inherit;font-weight:600;font-stretch:inherit;font-size:inherit;line-height:inherit;font-family:inherit;vertical-align:baseline;text-decoration:none;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li style="border:0px none ;margin:12px 0px 0px;padding:0px;font-style:inherit;font-variant:inherit;font-weight:inherit;font-stretch:inherit;font-size:inherit;line-height:inherit;font-family:inherit;vertical-align:baseline;"&gt;Sharks have been swimming in the ocean for more than 400 million years.&lt;/li&gt;

Their panoramic view of the undersea world is inhibited by two blind spots, one in front of the snout and the other directly behind the head.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="border:0px none ;margin:12px 0px 0px;padding:0px;font-style:inherit;font-variant:inherit;font-weight:inherit;font-stretch:inherit;font-size:inherit;line-height:inherit;font-family:inherit;vertical-align:baseline;"&gt;Sharks predate the dinosaurs by 200 million years.&lt;/li&gt;

Thank you, Google, for teaching me how to say "catching lots of fish?" in Spanish so they'd let me pass.  Must've been the secret phrase.  There were cottonwood pieces all over the place.

      &lt;p&gt;Information is taken from Wikipedia:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A computer is a general purpose device that can be programmed to carry out a finite set of arithmetic or logical operations. Since a sequence of operations can be readily changed, the computer can solve more than one kind of problem.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Conventionally, a computer consists of at least one processing element, typically a central processing unit (CPU) and some form of memory. The processing element carries out arithmetic and logic operations, and a sequencing and control unit that can change the order of operations based on stored information. Peripheral devices allow information to be retrieved from an external source, and the result of operations saved and retrieved.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The first electronic digital computers were developed between 1940 and 1945 in the United Kingdom and United States. Originally they were the size of a large room, consuming as much power as several hundred modern personal computers (PCs). In this era mechanical analog computers were used for military applications.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Modern computers based on integrated circuits are millions to billions of times more capable than the early machines, and occupy a fraction of the space. Simple computers are small enough to fit into mobile devices, and mobile computers can be powered by small batteries. Personal computers in their various forms are icons of the Information Age and are what most people think of as "computers". However, the embedded computers found in many devices from mp3 players to fighter aircraft and from toys to industrial robots are the most numerous.&lt;/p&gt;

        Searched for this cache while doing a little business travel. The focus was nabbing a few more higher D/T finds, grabbing some challenge caches, and adding a few counties - all of course as time allowed. There were many more caches that caught my eye, but just wasn't enough time.

Felt confident about our coords here.  Perhaps searching in the dark led to missing it.

neat. The cache location can only be visited during the following
hours (access is free):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Monday - Thursday&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;8am to 12am&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;

        Wow!! What an adventure! I first braved the icy roads in order to get to Lincoln from Grand Island. Then, with a few hours to kill before attending a concert, I turned to my favorite hobby. I wasn’t entirely sure what I might be getting myself into with this cache. I had managed to find parking near the concert location, so was hoping I wouldn’t have to venture too far. Since I had no idea what was what, I decided to start at the posted coordinates. Well, let’s just say that was easier said than done. I seldom approach complete strangers, but I did so today. I explained what I was doing and he hesitantly agreed to help me. Together, we viewed relevant material, and in just a few moments, we had a lead. The gentleman had some things to take care of, but he wished me luck and loaned me a pen (I had realized I had left mine in my geomobile!) Alone again, I was off to follow my lead. It wasn’t long before I was close to my target (unknowingly). This time, I was approached by a complete stranger. (I must have looked lost... which I was!) I told her about this lead I was following. She pointed out a direction and I blindly obeyed. Within moments, I was where I needed to be but still unsure of what was what. I looked around. No one was nearby, so I began to investigate my lead a little more closely. Finally, my eye caught sight of something that looked promising and I decided to verify my hunch. Eureka! The cache! Right under my nose! I browsed through the contents of the cache, left my mark, snapped some photos, and returned the cache to its proper location. Then I carefully made my way back to the first stranger I had encountered in order to return his pen. I assured him that I had succeeded in my mission and we chatted a little more about geocaching. The poor fellow was intrigued but owned neither a GPS or cellphone! We finally parted ways and I carefully navigated my way out of the maze. Thanks for an awesome adventure!

        Out with halllilley on a rainy day, doing rain-friendly caches.  I had done some library caches in Omaha so had a good idea of what to do.  Was surprised we were done so quickly.  So then we had to go to the Gnome door.  The librarian was very excited about showing it to us.  It was very interesting to know the library used to be Army barracks and they did 1/2 floors to get more soldiers in the building.  Go figure.  Thanks for a fun way to spend some time on a rainy day.

        Today I went with Monty12 to find a few caches in the area.  We started our quest at the "ASK US" desk where the person we talked to was very helpful.  Part of the task in finding the cache was getting to the correct in-between floor.  Once on the correct floor, I was surprised at how easy it was to find.  TFTC.  #5177.  SL.

      &lt;p&gt;The cache was placed with permission from the buisiness. Please respect the buisiness and landscaping during your search. The coordinates the cache takes you to first commemorates the initial use of the land. This site was first home to two churches, this plaque is for one of them. The First Congregational Church. Here you will gather your first piece of information required to gain access to the cache. What is the year the church was founded?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A = The year the church was organized&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current use of the land stands in front of you at the GZ, this is the second incarnation of the building. The first version of this historic hotel was demolished in 1982 to make way for the current incarnation of this hotel which stands before you now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now head to the Final coordinates in your Waypoints and use the information from the first stage to open the cache container. Please be kind to the landscaping and return as you found it. The cache "leash" should help you locate it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonus task: Complete the mission on the passport game card located in the final cache container to receive a reward! Please post a "Needs maintenance" if the game card stock gets below 5 so I restock for future players!&lt;/p&gt;

        Enjoyed my quick visit!! Thanks for the cool coin, fav point 

TFTC. SL. A few weeks ago when JSmiles07 suggested doing this GeoArt series, I thought he was high as a kite! Why would anyone want to spend so much time correcting the coords just for a bunch of PNGs? Then one day I was pretty bored at work, and the next thing you know, 310 caches got corrected. LOL, j/k, I probably spent 10-12 hours on that process over a period of 4-6 different days. Now that the hard work was done, we just had to plan a day to get them signed. Wanting to get this completed before MOGA, this Saturday was the only one available to both of us. So I dragged my butt out of bed at 02:30 to pick him up and we left his place before 4, heading west with spirits high. Started the series at 06:23 and with an hour break for lunch and gasoline, we were done by 15:00!! I was happy to stay behind the wheel as my knee is still sore from yesterday and J was the designated ditch jumper!

After finishing the whole Hand with plenty of daylight to spare, we came up with other plans. Did some recon at Pioneers Park, scored a sweet new trackable coin at the Cornhusker Marriott, and found the 3 virtuals in Lincoln.

Then someone discovered the Milestone Challenge Trail……….. ugh, haven’t we done enough? Nope, better sign them while we’re here. So we stopped in Nebraska City for supper and started on that series. 2.25 hrs later and we had a bunch more signed!! I’m sure I don’t qualify for some of these, but maybe someday.

Two more “oldies” on our way home, and since I suggested this challenge to him, felt a little obligated to drive him there. Glad I could wait in the warm truck and didn’t have to run each trail in the cold darkness. FYI, watch out for raccoons after sunset. LOL

It was a rewarding day, filled with many accomplishments. Here’s some quick stats:

333 finds (new daily record, and a cool “sign”)
0 DNF

3 virtuals, 300+ mystery types, and a few traditionals for another Triplet day!!

22.5 hrs awake, driving 588 miles.

Special thanks to the fine folks at MOGA for setting up this series, I can’t imagine how much work and planning this took!! Thanks also to bjmccacher for the fine challenge series, I’m sure I filled a few Fizzy spots with these!! CACHE ON!!!

        We came to Lincoln from Omaha solely to get this cache.  We wanted to be sure that we got a coin before MOGA came through and they were all claimed.  It was a lot of fun finding the cache, find the first stage was not hard but reading it in the rain proved a little difficult.  When we went to stage two we found the lock open.  We signed the log and made sure that the lock was secure before we left for the next part of the coin hunt.  That was a lot of fun and we were able to time it just right as a large group of people came out of the ballroom as we were leaving.  The only complaint that we have is that the parking at the hotel was a rip off.  When we came in we were to swipe a credit/debit card and remember which one we used.  The arm lifted and we drove in.  We we left there was an attendant at the exit who asked for our ticket.  S explained to him that we did not get a ticket and the process that we went through.  He did not care and charged us $11.25 for a lost ticket.  We were there for  about 47 minutes.  Went around to the entrance  see if we missed the ticket at some point, we did not.
10:17:57 PM Thanks for putting this out there HuntinTrea$ure.   We really appreciate the effort into the hunt.

        87° on March 19, 2017. Hmm......What are we going to do today? Cache? Of course!  

However, this isn't an ordinary day. Sure, the temperature is higher than normal, but the reason that this day is special, is because of challenge from the Geocaching Vlogger. He befriended a young man by the name of Michael Costello, who, unfortunately, had a form of Congenital Heart Disease, and he used geocaching as a way to get stronger. Sadly, he succumbed to his monster, and passed away just a few days ago. 

As a challenge, The Geocaching Vlogger asked that all of the geocachers go out today, Michael's birthday, and find a cache......and memorialize your excursion with a picture, or video, and mark it with #Geocache4Michael, on Facebook, or Instagram. He would then compile them into a video to mark this special day. 

So, I'm glad to say that I was happy to bring Sammalamma along with me to be a small part of this special day. 

We were joined by Itzzie, who did the mental legwork awhile ago, and we were glad to help her search for the final. Success! Tftc!

        Since I was in the area this evening, I decided to stop and try to make the find. Been awhile since I have cache at night and having to use a flashlight. Took longer than it should have to spot the container. Signed the log and replaced as found. Thanks for the great puzzle and cache.

      &lt;img src="http://img.geocaching.com/cache/large/5225afb7-687e-4773-a39d-1ae0828c92e4.jpg" /&gt;But seriously, the other day I really did meet a &lt;font color="pink"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font size="4"&gt;bear&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; . A great big giant purple panda bear. He said his name was &lt;img src="http://img.geocaching.com/cache/large/4571e073-0614-4ced-a61a-ef920c60c1ad.jpg" /&gt;Bigballooga4. He kind of reminded me of a giant whale balloon. Together we swirled and twirled above a &lt;font color="purple"&gt;&lt;font size="4"&gt;rainbow&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt; made of cotton candy. One thing led to another, swirling and twirling, twirling and swir1ing, next thing I knew, I’d taken a large bite out of the rainbow! Yikes, it didn’t taste like cotton candy at all! Suddenly, poof, Bigballooga4 floated away into the wild &lt;font color="red"&gt;&lt;font size="4"&gt;yellow&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt; yonder. I began to fall, rapidly, tumbling down the hills which were alive with the sound of thunder and unicorns &lt;img src="http://img.geocaching.com/cache/large/7a17b2c5-96bf-435e-ba78-017187b76614.png" /&gt; Now just calm down everyone, it’s not what you think. It’s not like that didn’t enter my &lt;font color="blue"&gt;&lt;font size="4"&gt;mind&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt; also!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
DISMI3SED!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Like my grandpa always said “you can’t build a bridge unless there are goldfish nearby” My grandpa was indeed a smart man!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I’m starting a tick farm at home, I’m sure many of you can relate! &lt;img src="http://img.geocaching.com/cache/large/267bf348-f98a-48fa-8a09-4ae55c3e058a.jpg" /&gt; All of 6this running through my head as I’m tumbling down the hills. When I hit the bottom, I bounced off a trampoline and straight into the den of a vicious mountain lion with no ears! &lt;img src="http://img.geocaching.com/cache/large/481c435d-7e68-4940-b28f-e392e943160f.png" /&gt;He tried to bite me. But let’s face it, I’m not made of mountain lion food or anything. So I did what any normal person would have &lt;font color="green"&gt;&lt;font size="4"&gt;done&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt; in my situation. Oh, don’t act like you wouldn’t have done the same thing! When the leprechaun finally forgave me, he became irritated again over this rainbow thing. He gave me the finger!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;font color="orange"&gt;&lt;font size="4"&gt;Well&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;, it was 2 fingers, but still &lt;img src="http://img.geocaching.com/cache/large/3e82ae34-2f40-4bed-abcd-cf42b6d03ae7.jpg" /&gt;RUDE! I guess I’ve ruined the pot of gold for everyone now. 9orry, it’s what I do! It’s how I roll&lt;img src="http://img.geocaching.com/cache/large/5815d815-2d72-48b0-aea3-ee583bc0f0a1.jpg" /&gt; ! I hope this important information puts everyone at ease. &lt;img src="http://img.geocaching.com/cache/large/1af93888-2f23-4820-98ba-3084b7e9a14f.jpg" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

        Was on my way to the "Thank you for being my friend......" event and decided to take time to search for a couple of nearby caches.  I had this solved in a matter of minutes; however, obtaining the container &amp; returning it took me quite a while... I needed a Wookie, but there were seemingly none available today.

        Loving the spot on D/T.
It seemed more difficult to put the stages back where they belong than to retrieve them, but we held fast and got them back.

        We worked through this cache one mini trip at a time.  Lost our coords for stage 2 at one point &amp; were looking at one of the stages twice before we even confirmed it was the right place.  We never really thought to go where it was with the guidelines our particular reviewer prefers. Still, it was fun, &amp; a bit challenging.  It seemed the D went up progressively with each stage.  Another TOTT was required that we haven't used for a while. A decent cache with good stars.   SL TFTC #3176

      This is a walk around Everett Elementary School.  

Listed coordinates get you to the starting point.  Find the numbers at each stop and use them in these math problems to get to the next point.

At #1 (Starting Coordinates), find the number, and convert (ABCD).  
Subtract 6 x D from starting coordinates for the #2 North.  
Add B - (A + C) to the starting coordinates for #2 West.

At #2, find the number (EFGH).  
Add (A + E) x ((E x F) - D) to #2 to get the #3 North.  
Subtract (10 x G) + E + F + H from #2 to get the #3 West.

At #3, find the number (IJK)--it is on it two times.  
Add (G - D) x (A + B + C + D + E + F + G + (2 x I)) to #3 to get the final North coordinate.  
Subtract (K^J) / (D - K) from #3 to get the final West coordinate.

The sum of all numbers (A + B + C + D + E + F + G + H + I + J + K) equals 49.

At #4, don't just stand there.  Look for the cache!

WARNING!  Extremely high Muggle area (check for kids and folks hanging out on porches).  Attempt during non-school hours.  Please, be EXTRA stealthy.  You do not need to access school grounds--no need to enter the play ground unless you have a child with you!

        87° on March 19, 2017. Hmm......What are we going to do today? Cache? Of course!  

However, this isn't an ordinary day. Sure, the temperature is higher than normal, but the reason that this day is special, is because of challenge from the Geocaching Vlogger. He befriended a young man by the name of Michael Costello, who, unfortunately, had a form of Congenital Heart Disease, and he used geocaching as a way to get stronger. Sadly, he succumbed to his monster, and passed away just a few days ago. 

As a challenge, The Geocaching Vlogger asked that all of the geocachers go out today, Michael's birthday, and find a cache......and memorialize your excursion with a picture, or video, and mark it with #Geocache4Michael, on Facebook, or Instagram. He would then compile them into a video to mark this special day. 

So, I'm glad to say that I was happy to bring Sammalamma along and meet up with Itzzie to find this cache as part of this memorable day. 

This was a tricky little bugger, but I'm glad we found it. Tftc!

        guru and I went to solve this the other night when we were in Lincoln.  We had all the correct coordinates for all the stages, but we were unable to find it even when we were right at GZ.  It was there all the time.  Maybe the sunny day helped.  It was another "Dah" experience when we grabbed it and signed the log. THANKS!

Golf - from Wikipedia

While the modern game of golf originated in 15th century Scotland, the game's ancient origins are unclear and much debated. Some historians trace the sport back to the Roman game of paganica, in which participants used a bent stick to hit a stuffed leather ball. One theory asserts that paganica spread throughout Europe as the Romans conquered most of the continent, during the first century BC, and eventually evolved into the modern game. Others cite chuiwan ("chui" means striking and "wan" means small ball) as the progenitor, a Chinese game played between the eighth and 14th centuries. A Ming Dynasty scroll dating back to 1368 entitled "The Autumn Banquet" shows a member of the Chinese Imperial court swinging what appears to be a golf club at a small ball with the aim of sinking it into a hole. The game is thought to have been introduced into Europe during the Middle Ages. Another early game that resembled modern golf was known as cambuca in England and chambot in France. This game was, in turn, exported to the Low Countries, Germany, and England (where it was called pall-mall, pronounced “pell mell”). Some observers, however, believe that golf descended from the Persian game, chaugan. In addition, kolven (a game involving a ball and curved bats) was played annually in Loenen, Netherlands, beginning in 1297, to commemorate the capture of the assassin of Floris V, a year earlier.

The modern game originated in Scotland, where the first written record of golf is James II's banning of the game in 1457, as an unwelcome distraction to learning archery. To many golfers, the Old Course at St Andrews, a links course dating to before 1574, is considered to be a site of pilgrimage. Golf is documented as being played on Musselburgh Links, East Lothian, Scotland as early as 2 March 1672, which is certified as the oldest golf course in the world by Guinness World Records. The oldest surviving rules of golf were compiled in March 1744 for the Company of Gentlemen Golfers, later renamed The Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers, which was played at Leith, Scotland. The world's oldest golf tournament in existence, and golf's first major, is The Open Championship, which was first played on 17 October 1860 at Prestwick Golf Club, in Ayrshire, Scotland.

A golf course consists of a series of holes, each with a teeing ground that is set off by two markers showing the bounds of the legal tee area, fairway, rough and other hazards, and the putting green surrounded by the fringe with the pin (normally a flagstick) and cup.
The levels of grass are varied to increase difficulty, or to allow for putting in the case of the green. While many holes are designed with a direct line-of-sight from the teeing area to the green, some holes may bend either to the left or to the right. This is commonly called a "dogleg", in reference to a dog's knee. The hole is called a "dogleg left" if the hole angles leftwards and "dogleg right" if it bends right. Sometimes, a hole's direction may bend twice; this is called a "double dogleg".

A typical golf course consists of 18 holes, but nine-hole courses are common and can be played twice through for a full round of 18 holes.
Early Scottish golf courses were primarily laid out on links land, soil-covered sand dunes directly inland from beaches. This gave rise to the term "golf links", particularly applied to seaside courses and those built on naturally sandy soil inland.
The first 18-hole golf course in the United States was located on a sheep farm in Downers Grove, Illinois, in 1892. The course is still situated there today.

Every round of golf is based on playing a number of holes in a given order. A 'round' typically consists of 18 holes that are played in the order determined by the course layout. On a standard course of 18 holes, each hole is played once in the round; on a nine-hole course, players may play a "short game" playing each hole once, or a "full round" by playing each hole twice.

Playing a hole on a golf course is initiated by putting a ball into play by striking it with a club on the teeing ground (also called the tee box, or simply the tee). For this first shot on each hole, it is allowed but not required for the golfer to place the ball on a tee prior to striking it. A tee in this last sense is a small peg which can be used to elevate the ball slightly above the ground up to a few centimetres high, which reduces the interference of the ground or grass on the movement of the club making the ball easier to hit, and also places the ball in the very center of the striking face of the club (the "sweet spot") for better distance. Tees are commonly made of wood but may be constructed of any material, including plastic. Traditionally, golfers used mounds of sand to elevate the ball, and containers of sand were provided for the purpose. A few courses still require sand to be used instead of peg tees, to reduce litter and reduce damage to the teeing ground.

When the initial shot on a hole is intended to move the ball a long distance (typically more than 225 yards), the shot is commonly called a 'drive' and is generally made with a long-shafted, large-headed wood club called a 'driver'. Shorter holes may be initiated with other clubs, such as higher-numbered woods orirons. Once the ball comes to rest, the golfer strikes it again as many times as necessary using shots that are variously known as a 'lay-up', an 'approach', a 'pitch', or a 'chip', until the ball reaches the green, where he or she then 'putts' the ball into the hole (commonly called "sinking the putt" or "holing out"). The goal of getting the ball into the hole ("holing" the ball) in as few strokes as possible may be impeded by obstacles such as areas of longer grass called 'rough' (usually found alongside fairways) which both slows any ball that contacts it and makes it harder to advance a ball that has stopped on it; 'doglegs', which are changes in the direction of the fairway that often require shorter shots to play around them; bunkers (or sand traps); and water hazards such as ponds or streams.

In stroke play competitions played according to strict rules, each player plays his or her ball until it is holed no matter how many strokes that may take, but in match play it is acceptable to simply pick up one's ball and "surrender the hole" after enough strokes have been made by a player that it is mathematically impossible for the player to win the hole. It is also acceptable in informal stroke play to surrender the hole after hitting three strokes more than the "par" rating of the hole (a "triple bogey" - see below); while technically a violation of Rule 3-2, this practice speeds play as a courtesy to others, and avoids "runaway scores", excessive frustration and injuries caused by overexertion.

Players can walk to their next shot or drive in golf carts over the course or along pathways beside it. The game can be played either individually or in groups and sometimes accompanied by caddies, who carry and manage the players' equipment and who are allowed by the rules to give advice on the play of the course. A caddy's advice can only be given to the player or players for whom the caddy is working, and not to competing players.
 
The rules of golf are internationally standardised and are jointly governed by The R&amp;A, spun off in 2004 from The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews (founded 1754), and the United States Golf Association (USGA).

The underlying principle of the rules is fairness. As stated on the back cover of the official rule book:

Play the ball as it lies, play the course as you find it, and if you cannot do either, do what is fair. 

There are strict regulations regarding the amateur status of golfers. Essentially, anybody who has ever received payment or compensation for giving instruction, or played golf for money, is not considered an amateur and may not participate in competitions limited solely to amateurs. However, amateur golfers may receive expenses which comply with strict guidelines and they may accept non-cash prizes within the limits established by the Rules of Amateur Status.

In addition to the officially printed rules, golfers also abide by a set of guidelines called golf etiquette. Etiquette guidelines cover matters such as safety, fairness, pace of play, and a player's obligation to contribute to the care of the course. Though there are no penalties for breach of etiquette rules, players generally follow the rules of golf etiquette in an effort to improve everyone's playing experience.
 
Penalties are incurred in certain situations. They are counted towards a player's score as if there were extra swing(s) at the ball. Strokes are added for rule infractions or for hitting one's ball into an unplayable situation.

A lost ball or a ball hit out of bounds result in a penalty of one stroke and distance (Rule 27–1). A one-stroke penalty is assessed if a player's equipment causes the ball to move or the removal of a loose impediment causes the ball to move (Rule 18–2). If a golfer makes a stroke at the wrong ball (Rule 19–2) or hits a fellow golfer's ball with a putt (Rule 19–5), the player incurs a two-stroke penalty. North forty fifty two dot three hundred. Most rule infractions lead to stroke penalties but also can lead to disqualification. Disqualification could be from cheating, signing for a lower score, or from rule infractions that lead to improper play.

Golf clubs are used to hit the golf ball. Each club is composed of a shaft with a lance (or 'grip') on the top end and a club head on the bottom. Long clubs, which have a lower amount of degreed loft, are those meant to propel the ball a comparatively longer distance, and short clubs a higher degree of loft and a comparatively shorter distance. Typically, the actual physical length of each club is longer or shorter, depending on the distance the club is intended to propel the ball.

Golf clubs have traditionally been arranged into three basic types. Woods are large-headed, long-shafted clubs meant to propel the ball a long distance from relatively "open" lies, such as the tee box and fairway. Of particular importance is the driver or "1-wood", which is the lowest lofted wood club, and in modern times has become highly specialized for making extremely long-distance tee shots, up to 300 yards or more in the hands of a professional golfer. Traditionally these clubs had heads made of a hardwood, hence the name, but virtually all modern woods are now made of metal such as titanium, or of composite materials. Irons are shorter-shafted clubs with a metal head primarily consisting of a flat, angled striking face. Traditionally the clubhead was forged from iron; modern iron clubheads are investment-cast from a steel alloy. Irons of varying loft are used for a variety of shots from virtually anywhere on the course, but most often for shorter-distance shots approaching the green, or to get the ball out of tricky lies such as sand traps. The third class is the putter, which evolved from the irons to create a low-lofted, balanced club designed to roll the ball along the green and into the hole. Putters are virtually always used on the green or in the surrounding rough/fringe. A fourth class, called hybrids, evolved as a cross between woods and irons, and are typically seen replacing the low-lofted irons with a club that provides similar distance, but a higher launch angle and a more forgiving nature.

A maximum of 14 clubs is allowed in a player's bag at one time during a stipulated round. The choice of clubs is at the golfer's discretion, although every club must be constructed in accordance with parameters outlined in the rules. (Clubs which meet these parameters are usually called 'conforming'.) Violation of these rules can result in disqualification.

The exact shot hit at any given time on a golf course, and which club is used to accomplish the shot, are always completely at the discretion of the golfer; in other words, there is no restriction whatsoever on which club a golfer may or may not use at any time for any shot.

Golf balls are spherical, usually white (although other colors are allowed), and minutely pock-marked by dimples that decrease aerodynamic drag by increasing air turbulence around the ball in motion, which delays "boundary layer" separation and reduces the drag-inducing "wake" behind the ball, thereby allowing the ball to fly farther.

A tee is allowed only for the first stroke on each hole, unless the player must hit a provisional tee shot or replay his or her first shot from the tee.

Many golfers wear golf shoes with metal or plastic spikes designed to increase traction, thus allowing for longer and more accurate shots. A golf bag is used to transport golf clubs and the player's other or personal equipment. Golf bags have several pockets designed for carrying equipment and supplies such as tees, balls, and gloves. Golf bags can be carried, pulled on a trolley or harnessed to a motorized golf cart during play. Golf bags have both a hand strap and shoulder strap for carrying, and sometimes have retractable legs that allow the bag to stand upright when at rest.
 
Golfers start with the non-dominant side of the body facing the target. At address the body and club are positioned parallel to the target line. The feet are commonly shoulder-width apart for middle irons and putters, narrower for short irons and wider for long irons and woods. The ball is positioned in the centre of the player's stance for short irons and putters, more to the front for middle irons and even more for long irons and woods. The golfer chooses a golf club, grip, and stroke appropriate to the distance:

•	The "drive" or "full swing" is used on the teeing ground and fairway, typically with a wood or long iron, to produce the maximum distance capable with the club.
•	The "approach" or "3/4 swing" is used in medium- and long-distance situations where an exact distance is preferable to maximum possible distance, such as to place the ball on the green or "lay up" in front of a hazard.
•	The "chip" or "half-swing" is used for relatively short-distance shots near the green, with high-lofted irons and wedges. The goal of the chip is to land the ball safely on the green, allowing it to roll out towards the hole. It can also be used from other places to accurately position the ball into a more advantageous lie.
•	The "putt" is used in short-distance shots on or near the green, typically made with the eponymous "putter", although similar strokes can be made with medium to high-numbered irons to carry a short distance in the air and then roll (a "bump and run"). The goal of the putt is to put the ball in the hole, although a long-distance putt may be called a "lag" and is made with the primary intention of simply closing distance to the hole or otherwise placing the ball advantageously.

Having chosen a club and stroke to produce the desired distance, the player addresses the ball by taking their stance to the side of it and (except when the ball lies in a hazard) grounding the club behind the ball. The golfer then takes their backswing, rotating the club, their arms and their upper body away from the ball, and then begins their swing, bringing the clubhead back down and around to hit the ball. West ninety six fourty four dot seven sixty nine. A proper golf swing is a complex combination of motions, and slight variations in posture or positioning can make a great deal of difference in how well the ball is hit and how straight it travels. The general goal of a player making a full swing is to propel the clubhead as fast as possible while maintaining a single "plane" of motion of the club and clubhead, to send the clubhead into the ball along the desired path of travel and with the clubhead also pointing that direction.

Accuracy and consistency is typically stressed over pure distance. A player with a straight drive that only travels 220 yards will nevertheless be able to accurately place the ball into a favorable lie on the fairway, and can make up for the lesser distance of any given club by simply using "more club" (a lower loft) on their tee shot or on subsequent fairway and approach shots. However, a golfer with a drive that may go 280 yards but often doesn't fly straight will be less able to position their ball advantageously; the ball may "hook", "pull", "draw", "fade", "push" or "slice" off the intended line and land out of bounds or in the rough or hazards, and thus the player will require many more strokes to hole out.
 
A hole is classified by its par, meaning the number of strokes a skilled golfer should require to complete play of the hole. Par always includes a stroke for the tee shot and two putts, so the minimum par of any hole is 3, but pars of 4 and 5 strokes are common, and a few courses feature par-6 and even par-7 holes. Strokes other than the tee shot and putts are expected to be made from the fairway; for example, a skilled golfer expects to reach the green on a par-4 hole in two strokes—one from the tee (the 'drive') and another, second, stroke to the green (the 'approach')—and then roll the ball into the hole in two putts for par. Putting the ball on the green with two strokes remaining for putts is called making "green in regulation" or GIR.

The primary factor for classifying the par of a relatively straight, hazard-free hole is the distance from the tee to the green. A typical par-3 hole is less than 250 yards (225 m) in length, with a par-4 hole ranging between 251 and 475 yards (225–434 m), and a par-5 hole being longer than 475 yards (435 m). The rare par-6s can stretch well over 650 yards (595 m). These distances are based on the typical scratch golfer's drive distance of between 240-280 yards; a green further than the average player's drive will require additional shots from the fairway. However, other considerations must be taken into account; the key question is "how many strokes would a scratch golfer take to make the green by playing along the fairway?". The grade of the land from the tee to the hole might increase or decrease the carry and rolling distance of shots as measured linearly along the ground. Sharp turns or hazards may require golfers to "lay up" on the fairway in order to change direction or hit over the hazard with their next shot. These design considerations will affect how even a scratch golfer would play the hole, irrespective of total distance from tee to green, and must be included in a determination of par. However, a par score never includes "expected" penalty strokes, as a scratch player is never "expected" to hit a ball into a water hazard or other unplayable situation. So, the placement of hazards only affect par when considering how a scratch golfer would avoid them.

Eighteen-hole courses typically total to an overall par score of 72 for a complete round; this would be four par-3, ten par-4, and four par-5 holes, though other combinations exist and are not less worthy than courses of par-72. Many major championships are contested on courses playing to a par of 70, 71, or 72 (typically reducing the number of par-4 holes for par-3s and trading distance for difficulty). Additionally, in some countries, courses are classified according to their play difficulty, which may be used to calculate a golfer's playing handicap for a given course. Two par-72 courses may have different difficulties; the more difficult course will typically have distances in the upper end of each par rating, more hazards, narrower or "shallower" fairways, hillier or more uneven terrain, etc. which all make the course harder to play even when the basic par score determinants are the same.
 
In 2005, Golf Digest calculated that the countries with most golf courses per capita, starting with the best endowed were: Scotland, New Zealand, Australia, Republic of Ireland, Northern Ireland, Canada, Wales, United States, Sweden, and England (countries with fewer than 500,000 people were excluded). Apart from Sweden, all of these countries have English as the majority language, but the number of courses in new territories is increasing rapidly.

The most notable example of this phenomenon is the expansion of golf in China. The first golf course in China opened in 1984, but by the end of 2009 there were roughly 600 in the country. For the last several years, development of new golf courses in China has been officially banned (with the exception of the island province of Hainan), but the number of courses had nonetheless tripled from 2004 to 2009; the "ban" has been easily evaded with the government's tacit approval simply by not mentioning golf in any development plans.

In the United States, the number of people who play golf twenty-five times or more per year decreased from 6.9 million in 2000 to 4.6 million in 2005, according to the National Golf Foundation. The NGF reported that the number who played golf at all decreased from 30 to 26 million over the same period.

      M is for Muggles -
     </groundspeak:short_description>
     <groundspeak:long_description html="True">
      &lt;p&gt;A ‘muggle’, in Geocaching terms, is a non-Geocacher, a person not playing the game, and usually not aware of Geocaching. The term is based on ‘muggle’ from the Harry Potter book series by A. K. Rowling which refers to a non-magical person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concern with muggles is that they may discover a Geocache, either accidently or by seeing a Geocacher accessing it, and then possibly destroying it. This is referred to as the Geocache being ‘muggled’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often times, especially in urban areas, Geocaches are placed in high-traffic areas where there are a lot of muggles around. While this may add to the thrill in finding a cache it also adds to the risk of it being found. This risk is increased when a Geocacher is accessing and logging the find. Geocachers must take great care to ensure that Geocaches are not muggled.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is a series of caches all being letterboxes, none of the hides are tough, just look in the obvious locations. Some of the micro sized containers, do not contain an ink pad, so please bring your own if you choose to stamp. Do not take the stamp or ink pad, they must stay in the container.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;

        Found this cache during epic trip out west with NikCap and Geo-Nat. We had several main goals set for the week - see total solar eclipse, find the oldest caches in NE and KS and find 150+ non traditional caches. We succeeded on all the accounts! That was definitely a week we will remember for the long time. Great times and lots of amazing (and some not so amazing) cache. Thanks for bringing us to this location and thanks for the cache!

      Technology - pulled from wikipedia&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Technology is the making, modification, usage, and knowledge of tools, machines, techniques, crafts, systems, methods of organization, in order to solve a problem, improve a preexisting solution to a problem, achieve a goal or perform a specific function. It can also refer to the collection of such tools, machinery, modifications, arrangements and procedures. Technologies significantly affect human as well as other animal species' ability to control and adapt to their natural environments. The word technology comes from Greek τεχνολογία (technología); from τέχνη (téchnē), meaning "art, skill, craft", and -λογία (-logía), meaning "study of-".[1] The term can either be applied generally or to specific areas: examples include construction technology, medical technology, and information technology.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The human species' use of technology began with the conversion of natural resources into simple tools. The prehistorical discovery of the ability to control fire increased the available sources of food and the invention of the wheel helped humans in travelling in and controlling their environment. Recent technological developments, including the printing press, the telephone, and the Internet, have lessened physical barriers to communication and allowed humans to interact freely on a global scale. However, not all technology has been used for peaceful purposes; the development of weapons of ever-increasing destructive power has progressed throughout history, from clubs to nuclear weapons.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Technology has affected society and its surroundings in a number of ways. In many societies, technology has helped develop more advanced economies (including today's global economy) and has allowed the rise of a leisure class. Many technological processes produce unwanted by-products, known as pollution, and deplete natural resources, to the detriment of the Earth and its environment. Various implementations of technology influence the values of a society and new technology often raises new ethical questions. Examples include the rise of the notion of efficiency in terms of human productivity, a term originally applied only to machines, and the challenge of traditional norms.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Philosophical debates have arisen over the present and future use of technology in society, with disagreements over whether technology improves the human condition or worsens it. Neo-Luddism, anarcho-primitivism, and similar movements criticise the pervasiveness of technology in the modern world, opining that it harms the environment and alienates people; proponents of ideologies such as transhumanism and techno-progressivism view continued technological progress as beneficial to society and the human condition. Indeed, until recently, it was believed that the development of technology was restricted only to human beings, but recent scientific studies indicate that other primates and certain dolphin communities have developed simple tools and learned to pass their knowledge to other generations.&lt;br /&gt;

        I solved this a looooong time ago but tonight was the night to make the find!  Gotta get that souvenir!  ;)  I brought my sidekick GoblinKid with me and he added an eraser for swag.

        One of the post eclipse caches that Jo.Cap and I found while visiting Lincoln. There was a trifecta of puzzle caches in this area that I couldn't pass up.  Found without too much of an issues. For the puzzle, took me a couple of shots to get this one working.  Not sure why I had difficulties ... I guess it's _________. lol

        Found this cache during epic trip out west with NikCap and Geo-Nat. We had several main goals set for the week - see total solar eclipse, find the oldest caches in NE and KS and find 150+ non traditional caches. We succeeded on all the accounts! That was definitely a week we will remember for the long time. Great times and lots of amazing (and some not so amazing) cache. Thanks for bringing us to this location and thanks for the cache!

&lt;center&gt;&lt;font size="5"&gt;of a cache I've seen somewhere along the geocaching trails! I'm not going to say much about it, but at times, this area of the park can be extremely busy, if its being used at the time, please come back later to do your searching. There is no reason to take anything off the structure, let your fingers do the walking. The park closes at 11pm, do not enter it after this time. I request you re-hide each stage exactly as you have found it. GOOD LUCK and as always, be prepared! Do not use any park equipment for your searching, please bring your own "get tall" equipment&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

        Stage1 took 2 visits.  The first we looked &amp; looked for a long time, including what eventually turned out to be the right idea but wrong GZ. Thought we were onto something in a certain spot until we looked at it in detail with our TOTT &amp; realized we found something else entirely, darn.  We had no hints as to what or where to look other than, after being there for a while, we got a simple response to "how good are these coords" which sent us to the wrong area as well, sigh.  Jimmy63 had hurt his hands while searching, so we left before the mosquitoes sucked us dry.  Went back the second time using the same 2 TOTTs but in a different area doing a place by place sweep.  "Wait, what was that?  Hold on, that couldn't be it could it? YES!"  Almost missed it again.  Feeling all excited that we got it on our own, we ventured off to the final area sure we'd make quick work of it.  But alas, no.  We made 3 visits with no luck before claiming our DNF.

        Denmother and I were visiting friends in Nebraska this weekend.  Between times, we did a little caching and ended up here. We assisted the cache owner on some maintenance with this one. The first waypoint is evil. I wish I had a recording of his laugh to play here. The final took a little balancing act to grab, but all is now well. Thanks, bjmccacher, for placing this cache.

&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a series of Geocache Adventures created for the entire family. This treasure hunt is full of fun surprises and large caches for plenty of swag. All the episodes of this Adventure are in Pioneer's Park, Lincoln, Nebraska. The kids will enjoy printing and coloring the adventure book pages below. PLEASE post any PHOTOS of the fun. We post these photos at &lt;a href="http://www.lannyandcoe.com/index.php/12-current-caches/16-ep2-stolen-jewels" target="_blank"&gt;www.lannyandcoe.com&lt;/a&gt;. Please no spoilers!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE CACHE:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This a very fun single stage multicache. Both parts of this mulitcache are in Pioneer's Park. If you use your map skills wisely, you will barely have to leave any path. However some of the paths are less marked than others. Please return everything how you found it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE STORY:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Continued from &lt;a href="http://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC5QGJ9_lc-ep1-the-criminals-cache?guid=113ef3aa-324b-4ed0-b1a7-093c079a4246" target="_blank"&gt;L&amp;amp;C Ep1. The Criminal's Cache (Pioneer's Park)&lt;/a&gt; ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The boys couldn’t believe they had actually stumbled across a real criminal. What they had just found meant one thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was on the run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We have to follow him.” Lanny said as he shut the lid and looked up toward the path the man had taken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What?!?” Coe gasped. “Are you crazy?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Seriously Coe, come on. We can’t let him just get away. What if he’s going to try to hurt someone?” Lanny was nervous, but confident. They needed to try to do the right thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Why can’t we just go get help?” Coe asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Because, he’s on the move right now. If we don’t follow him and at least see what he’s doing, he could get away and do something terrible! We need to act now!” Lanny started to move in the direction the man had gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coe hesitated, but unable to come up with a good enough reason to argue his point further, he begrudgingly followed his older brother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They followed the man from a fairly safe distance. He stayed in the thick forest near the river, obviously trying to keep from being seen by anyone. Every once in a while he would stop and pull something out of his pocket and then look around. He was obviously trying to find something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever he stopped, the boys had to stop as well, being extra careful not to crunch any leaves or snap any twigs. The slightest noise might signal the man to their presence and being alone in the woods with a real criminal did not sound like fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the man slowed down and followed a fence and approached a specific tree. He looked it up and down a few times and then seemed to find what he was looking for, positioned on the tree somewhat facing the boys. They couldn’t exactly see what he was doing, but they saw him slide out a small canister, and remove a map or something from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He unrolled it, studied it for a moment, looked off towards the northeast, then rolled it back up and placed it back into the canister. After that he was off again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lanny was torn. They meant to follow the man, but now he wanted to know what was in the canister. He figured that whatever was in there had given the man his next destination, so maybe they could both see what was in it and still follow him. They waited until the sounds of the man’s steps were faint and then made for the tree. Coe must have been curious too because he didn’t say a word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They got there together and were confused. Nothing stood out as an obvious container for the canister. Frustrated, Lanny scowled angrily at the tree. He figured it would be right there waiting for them, but based on the place where the criminal had hid his handcuffs, it must be well placed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What’s that?” Coe suddenly said, breaking the silence. He was pointing at the tree. Suddenly, Lanny saw it too, a marking of some kind. He inspected it for a moment, grabbed the object, and pulled hard. He almost fell back when the lid came off so easily. By the time he recovered, he looked up and saw the canister inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was crazy. Only someone with something serious to hide would go to this much trouble to conceal things. They opened the canister and unrolled the map found within. It took Lanny a moment but then he realized what it was. He quickly rolled the map back up, put it and the canister back, and then replaced the lid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I know what where he went.” This was all he said as he grabbed Coe’s hand and headed in the same direction as the criminal.&lt;/p&gt;

        Came out with J&amp;LA to check out this park after we worked on the new geo art and event for MOGA. She had most of this park finished but was generous to take me around and give help on various caches. Good multi here will give it a favorite for that and containers are inventive and go with story.

        Found it for real. Surprising how many can "find it" but can't seem to get the log signed for some reason. Giving a favorite point for container. Last entry in log was 7/27/2017. Clues were a bit puzzling but finally got it figured out. SIGNED log.  TFTH

        An excellent little puzzle.  I was able to make the find even though the coordinate checker isn't working anymore.  If you have been planning to go for this one, I recommend going soon.  I saw construction equipment at the site.  I think they may be doing some renovations soon.  The site will be off-limits.

      I thought it would be nice to do an easy to mid-range difficulty puzzle instead of aiming for a five star one since there are already several very challenging puzzles in the area. This cache is not located at the posted coordinates. Those are simply coordinates to the parking area. The cache will require a walk of over .2 mile but under .5 mile. There are nettles in the general area, so  long pants are suggested.

      To find the cache, figure out the coordinates from the text below. The cache is a lock-n-lock type container.

I think this cache will take some thought but will not really be all that hard. I will post a hint and/or adjust the rating if needed though.

Caches with math are not my thing
I usually get them wrong 
But I am one who likes to read
Don't know about anyone else
Easy for you math might be
Gauging from some puzzles I have seen
Jesting I am not
Algebra, division, multiplication etc.
Wicked they are to me

Instead of math I give you this
Even with numbers you need not add (2+2=4)
Even with numbers you need not subtract (4-2=2)
Geometry has no place here
Even algebra you need not fear
All you have to do is read
Eventually the numbers will be clear
No, no nooooooo math, zero math is here 

Two times six is twelve or so they claim
Although ten fingers is all I have
So I guess I really can’t say
In my world the numbers often get confused
Even though I got an A in college algebra
Here I am learning to count on toes
Can’t there be a better way?
Alas in angst I lose track of things
Considering that I can’t divide forty by ninety-six
Even so I will get by
Hail to the great mechanical calculator
Time to check that the puzzle is right.

      The cache is not located at the coordinates provided.

The cache is located at N40 _ _. _ _ _, W096 _ _. _ _ _.
The rest of the coordinates can be obtained by decoding the following story:

Back in his day, Mr. Woods liked to travel across this great Union, meeting people and informing them of special events.  Mr. Woods had a son named Wes.  One day, Mr. Woods took Wes deer hunting. While sitting high above the ground in the deer stand like birds on a wire, young Wes asked his father “When the time comes, where shall I go ahead and shoot the deer?”  A frustrated Mr. Woods told his son “Keep still!”  Hearing some crunching leaves nearby, Wes tapped on his rifle, making soft ‘tap, tappity, tap, tap’ sounds. Mr. Woods raised his hand and whispered,  “Wait a minute.”  A few seconds later, with a grin on his face, young Wes asked “What time is it?”

The following week, Wes ran into his father’s office and began to ask him a question.  Being the busy man he was, Mr. Woods raised his hand and said, “ I am busy on the other line.”  Wes was patient.  He waited until his father stopped what he was doing, turned, and said,  “I am ready” before continuing with his question. “I understand that I am to… become a man someday,” Wes said to his father.  “What I need to know is will you have any business for me?”  Mr. Woods thought about it for a moment before saying “I don’t know.”

Once you figure out the coordinates, the cache should not be too difficult to find.  Let your caching instincts guide you.  The cache is located adjacent to a strategic point of Lincoln infrastructure, so stealth is advised when going after the cache.  If you have solved this puzzle, you should be smart enough to figure out an easy way to conceal your activities and blend in with the muggles that frequent the area. You will probably have what you need in your car. If you are lucky and approach this cache at the right time, your activities should be completely concealed and you will be free to enjoy your success in peace.

The cache is located in an urban area on flat, paved ground and might be considered a “park and grab” by those cachers used to vigorous rural hunts. Although I scouted and hid this cache on crutches with a broken leg (thus its name), I cannot guarantee that this cache is accessible to all physically challenged individuals.  Due to circumstances beyond my control with the spacing of objects around the cache, those in wheel chairs may not be able to get in close enough to reach the cache. 

The original contents of the cache are:
A not yet activated Travel Bug Dog Tag – FTF Prize!
A 2-pack of red Chem Light Stix
2 mini fishing bobbers
1 1/8th oz. Lindy rig fishing weight
3 Ducks Unlimited label pins, and
1 M&amp;M football dude 

Please make sure the cache is secure before returning it to its hiding spot to prevent it from falling. Thanks!  Have fun and good luck!

        I had the idea for this one almost right away, but couldn't get it to work out.  When I remotely looked at the posted location, I knew I was on the right track, but still couldn't get it to sort out. I send out a couple of messages to previous finders, (as it seems the CO isn't available) and got some helpful replies that said I was on the right track.  The confidence build put me on the solution quickly.  
While we were in Lincoln to see the Solar Eclipse, we figured we would grab a could of this solved puzzle caches.

        Found this cache during epic trip out west with NikCap and Geo-Nat. We had several main goals set for the week - see total solar eclipse, find the oldest caches in NE and KS and find 150+ non traditional caches. We succeeded on all the accounts! That was definitely a week we will remember for the long time. Great times and lots of amazing (and some not so amazing) cache. Thanks for bringing us to this location and thanks for the cache!
***Group of NJ geocachers tried to solve this one, but it was NikCap who deciphered the coords, we were delighted to see that the cache was still there and in very good shape***

        We started this a while back.  Had to do it in shifts because without really knowing the park, &amp; we always seemed to get here right before sundown &amp; would run out of sunlight to help us see the possibilites. Took a lot of random wandering around, that's for sure.  Sometimes where we expected a stage to be, it turned out to be something else entirely.  We didn't trip any booby traps, but the wasps near one stage (now covered in big tree branches) were a bit pesky.  FINALLY got around to getting the final before heading to the CO's farewell dinner.  Jimmy had along the perfect TOTT, but even after dislodging the cache he didn't realize it.  Luckily, LA thought she saw something fall &amp; investigated, expecting it to be just a rock or bug. Alas, it was the treasure. SL TFTC #2848

        We get the first part done, and go to where we are told. Then look around and have one idea. Go and check it out. Nothing. But then had another idea as we were leaving that led us to the next part. After that, we were lost. I don't know if not being from around here stopped us in our tracks or not, but we couldn't continue. We tried one theory, but that felt like we were grasping at straws more than anything. Messaged the CO but didn't hear back in time before we left town. Maybe next time we're in town for MOGA 2018?

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;font size="4" face="bloody" color="red"&gt;Welcome to the 7 Deadly Sins. Study these and prepare yourself, that way you are ready for what you are about to see while searching for these caches: Greed, Lust, Envy, Pride, Gluttony, Wrath, and Sloth. These caches were placed with the 7 sins in mind and hopefully you can appreciate the hard work that was put into these hides. We request that those of you that find these caches remain discreet and do not give away anything to future seekers. Please allow the CO's to help anyone that may need help. This will allow all cachers to enjoy the challenges that these caches provide, and the containers of the 7 Deadly Sins Series.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Description:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Gluttony is an inordinate desire to consume more than that which one requires. Gluttony is also known as an excess of things.&lt;br /&gt;

        Fun cache for this time of year making the hide a little easier to find....glad to get out to this part of the park. Only thing in the cache was a damp torn off heading of the owner.....no log. I made a make-shift attatchment of the heading onto a new strip of paper. Should be good for awhile.

      This is a mini multi, only 2 stages. First stage will take you to a stone, you will get a couple numbers from this stone and continue on to the 2nd and final stage. Please be careful where you park, I have been to GZ 3 times, and a state patrol man (or woman) lives right near here, and there's a lot of no parking signs. Just your fair warning!

     <groundspeak:long_description html="False">
      When you arrive to GZ, you can see something where Geocachers like to put nanos, I'm afraid, I probably have placed one there. But, to help you track it down. You can get coordinates from stage 1 of the multi. 

Once you get to the stone, you will need two numbers. 

1st number will get you to the North coordinates. Get the last digit of the year that Albert was born, add 5. Now add that number to the north coords. 

To get the west coordinates, divide the last 2 digits of the year Idella passed away by 2 and subtract 11. 
Now add this number to the west coords. 

Go sign your name to the log if you can find it.

        I'd thrown my standard decryption tools at this one at least four times in the past year to no avail.  Finally broke down and asked the CO for a hint, but he didn't remember how he enciphered it [:(], however he knew it was fairly easy to break...  I suspect that he suffers from CHFS (Cache-hider's fatigue syndrome), and all those hides are blending into one.

So I decided to contact a recent finder for a nudge.  After getting his help, all I can say is that I doubt that I'd ever would have broken the code.  I was completely off the mark in my thinking.  

[5 minutes later] 

Decrypted coordinates put it right where I thought it should be hidden based upon other information on the cache page, the general 1 mile rule (final location within a mile of posted), and my previous finds--guess I should have just gone out and poked around.  Anyway, I feel quite relieved to have the coordinates and will pay it a visit in the next few days.

Dang this hobby is tough!

        After finishing up on a few errands for the day, it was time for my daily cache run. Solved the puzzle last night and added it to the list for ones to grab today. Got a close parking spot and made the short walk over to GZ. Yep, right where I thought it was going to be hiding. Signed my name to the logsheet and replace as found. Thanks for the puzzle and the cache.

        Thank you for bringing me here.  I spend a lot of time in this cemetery since a dear friend lost her life way to soon in 2010.  I stopped to visit her today and just love my time here.  This is the most beautiful cemetery ever and makes me feel so very peaceful.  Her name is Katy and she passed away suddenly at 23 on her sons 4th birthday.  Say hello as you pass through.  As for the cache..... Totally recruited team F&amp;A for assistance on this.  Way out of my league, although I pry have over an hour into working on it.  Glad to have it off my list and glad to know you!!!

      **DISCLAIMER** This will take you to multiple locations after the first stage, so please be prepared to drive through town. It may take more than one day, or one trip, to complete all of the stages. You may want to attempt this in a group. If you get stumped please feel free to email us. Please: when logging a find, do not indicate any spoilers! Pics are fine just nothing revealing GZ or containers :)
     </groundspeak:short_description>
     <groundspeak:long_description html="True">
      You will find a MULTI-tude of containers (there is a "container" of some sort at each stage), field puzzles and adventures throughout the stages. We apologize in advance that you don’t get to claim a smiley for every stage; we KNOW that you will definitely earn them! We came up with this cache as a tribute to Twofingersdown, Bjmccacher and Whichwaydidigo; who have a combined total of over 11,000 finds! When we began caching last year, we reached out to the local caching community and stumbled upon these gentlemen. They have been an instrumental part of caching for us and helped us become fairly seasoned in a very short period of time. They are always eager and willing to answer our nonsensical questions, entertain our goofy notions and chaperon us in the right direction...... Which doesn’t make us like multis or puzzles any better! On the same note, one of them is rather tough and insists that we walk the walk and challenges us to find our own way…… Everything we know we owe to them! We hope that this tribute will make them proud of us and prove that we can hang with the kewl kids! For anyone who is not familiar with the KrayzeeKuzins duo, we consist of Krayzeekidd and Itzzie. We both own a few hides individually and we have a couple that we co-own together. This is our first multi. It has been months of preparation and we have had a ton of fun taking everything they have taught us and wrapping it up into one cache to honor their expertise. They have been amazing mentors who we now call friends! Thank you for everything! We hope you enjoy this cache! Our goal is to earn a blue ribbon from every finder because we were challenged to "impress me and I'll give you a favorite point" by one of the above named cachers. You know who you are. ;) REMEMBER…… Girls rule and Boys drool!!! PLEASE DON'T FORGET TO BRING YOUR PEN! Congratulations to the small group that got FTF! Consisting of the Twofingersdown, Bjmccacher, Whichwaydidigo, Majorhusker, Sammalamma and Sparkydoo. Kudos to you all for taking a day out of your lives to find this hide. We appreciate your dedication and we are glad you enjoyed finding this Multi!!!! Hope you didn’t get caught drooling ;) PLEASE do not give out hints to any stages to other cachers. Please refer them to us anyone can text us for hints/clues. Itzzie (Kia) 402-318-9882 Krayzeekidd (Lindsey) 402-202-2305. Thanks for keeping this cache top secret and saving the D rating for all to discover!!!!

        I am horrible at logging caches and I'm back logging this months after I actually found this because I SUCK! Back to the original task at hand... This Multi was SO MUCH FUN! We HT and I had the pleasure Of having one of the Co tag along with us for most of this multi, I'm sure we provided hours of entertainment for her :) I completed the first few stages of this multi with my Daughter months before HT and I ended up finishing this. But we didn't get to far because of the weather. Anyways, We had lots of laughs and had an awesome time completing this multi! It is def one everyone should go attempt! You will have a blast! The containers are well thought out and so much fun :) Thanks you guys! Favorite point for sure!!

        Got started on this before the New Year's event, got some help from the CO &amp; came up with coords that took us right back to within 20 ft our our previous stop, then 3 more stages out we signed a log.  Didn't match the name, but we thought since it was close...well, after chasing down a number of DGS sloth stages with BransonAdventure, we came upon this same stage again.  Confused we looked at our coords &amp; they were nearly he same.  Huh??? Turns out we completely missed typing in the coords we were supposed to have for this one &amp; randomly found ourselves at a cache stage. We decided to go find this one &amp; make it official.  Had trouble with the TOTTs we chose, &amp; the girls both got scratched on their faces from thorn trees to the point of bleeding.  Still was fun &amp; a funny story.  SL TFTC #1901

      This is a 5 stage multi, at each stage you will be finding a container that will give you the coordinates to the next stage. This multi stage cache will give you a tour of fallbrook, a newer upscale neighborhood in northwest lincoln.
     </groundspeak:short_description>
     <groundspeak:long_description html="False">
      Three of the first 4 stages you will be looking for camo'd pill bottles, the other one being bison tubes.  

The final stage (stage 5) you will be looking for a large jug. It was a container I received in the gift exchange at this years (2011) holiday party at Valentino's in Omaha. It is plenty big for swag (which it is already full of) and trackable items. This is the only stage that will take you off the trail. I hope you enjoy your tour of Fallbrook.

        What an adventure!  We did some Krayzeekidd P&amp;Gs where we shouldn't have and ended up getting questioned by a police officer.  He didn't know what geocaching was, so we asked if he knew what Pokemon Go was.  He did, so we started explaining geocaching and showed him the map.  He was cool with it and let us leave our car parked there.  Phew!  LOL!  Ended up wasting our time searching fire the wrong type of container at the final (which is now the 4th stage), but persistence paid off and we got our name on the log.  Thanks for the fun multi!  :)

      Shortly after my parents got married, they started bowling a league together. As each of their kids were born, they put us in bowling leagues as soon as they could. Sometimes, so young we couldn't always get the ball down the lane.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I became pretty serious about the sport once I entered high school, getting a job at a local bowling center, and I started bowling 100 games a week (to this day, I claim to be well practiced, and not very good!). I still have never had a perfect game, but my high game is one of the games in the sheet that you will be scoring to get the correct coordinates for the cache. Can you guess which one?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Update - Seems as if coords may be off a little bit, if you find this before I update, please check the hint, it will help you in your search!&lt;br /&gt;

        I use to love bowling.   It was great family fun.  My mother, Colleen, bowled back in the 70's at a placed called Leisure Lanes in Omaha, NE.  There, they had a Sunday TV show called Bowling at Leisure.  My mother was on Sunday morning TV a lot back in the day.  She was quite a bowler. FP for a fond memory.     SL...   TFTC...  :-)

      &lt;p&gt;The "Witch of the Woods" is NOT located at the posted coordinates. You must find the shrines of the missing children and see what clues they have left there to help you in your search for her location.&lt;/p&gt;
     </groundspeak:short_description>
     <groundspeak:long_description html="True">
      &lt;p&gt;In the 1980s', there were about a half dozen children that went missing from the West A Street neighborhood. Many families believed the children ran away, but other families believed that the children disappeared in Wilderness Park. There was no formal investigation until the sister of one of the boys that went missing claimed to see him with a woman who lived in a secluded shack in the woods of Wilderness Park. Local residents have called this woman "Witch of the Woods" since the early 1900s'. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Local police searched the wooded areas of the park and had not found any traces of the children that had disappeared. The police questioned the woman who lived in the shack and she only complained about how so many children had ran all over her property, harassed her and her animals, and vandalized the woods. There was no hard evidence against her, so the authorities did not make an arrest. However, once the local residents heard what the woman had said they took matters into their own hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The "Witch of the Woods" was found one day, hanging from a tree with a chain wrapped around her neck. Many people say that when you walk the trails of the park at night, you can hear the moans of the witch and occasionally the rattles of chains. Some claim to have actually found buried chains that have led to the tree where the woman was hung.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There has been shrines placed in the woods that memorialize the children that had lost their lives so many years ago. It has been rumored that the spirit of four children have left clues in their shrines to help others find the location of where the witch met her ultimate fate of death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are four children and where you may find their shrines:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Missing child #1 - The Witch of the Woods GC6W79G&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Missing child #2 - The Witch of the Woods GC6W79T&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Missing child #3 - The Witch of the Woods GC6W7N5&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Missing child #4 - The Witch of the Woods GC6W7NK&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finding the shrines, and using the information left by the spirits, you can find the location of the "Witch of the Woods". Are you willing to help the spirits of the children and help ease their souls? Are you willing to face the "Witch of the Woods"? Be careful what you find at the end though, because they say the witch is still looking for souls of the misguided to stay and roam the woods with her.&lt;/p&gt;

      Your name must be on the physical log to be able to count it as a find!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Micro caches often contain nothing more than a strip of paper. In the case of nano caches that strip of paper might be very small. Nano log books may only have room for your initials.  Slightly larger micros may have room for your geocaching handle and maybe a date.  If  you found a small, regular or large cache you may have room to write more.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you encounter a logbook where there is enough room to leave more than your initials or geocaching handle, go ahead and write. Many cache owners and other geocachers enjoy reading logs, so don't be afraid to write a paragraph, or more.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This is not the case for this logbook, since it is a micro container, please either stamp it or initial it. Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is a series of caches all being letterboxes, none of the hides are tough, just look in the obvious locations. Some of the micro sized containers, do not contain an ink pad, so please bring your own if you choose to stamp. Do not take the stamp or ink pad, they must stay in the container.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

cancer at the age of 5. We have wanted to put a cache in this area
in memory of him. The first leg of this cache starts near the
Lincoln Children&amp;rsquo;s Zoo. Josh had a profound love of zoo
animals. From there you will have a drive across town to the second
and third caches. This is a themed cache. Please exchange only
animals in this cache. We hope that this is a fun cache for

      This puzzle cache is twice as fun! Yep, you got it, there are two different ciphers in this one.&lt;br /&gt;

twofingersdown has been placing caches in honor of other cachers, I felt like he deserved one in return. This cache hide, isn't necessarily how he would hide a cache, but, the difficulty is in the puzzle. Whenever I need help with puzzles, I always go to him first. So, maybe this time, he might have to come to me!&lt;br /&gt;

        After finding "Opposite", MacFive and I attended "Ghost Stories and Urban Legends."  I hadn't planned on going caching as well as the event tonight, but we found ourselves in the spirit of things and decided to go after "just one more"... as any self-respecting cacher would. [;)]
The glow was barely there and not visible from the cache coordinates.  There were a couple of likely spots; we started with those and it didn't take long.  We didn't see the eyes until we were only a few feet away...maybe the glow has worn off?  After SL for my #2289 [:D] cache, we experimented with various geolights and were able to get a fairly good photo.
Caching with a good cache buddy is always fun and tonight was no exception. TFTUnknownC!

        Found this cache during epic trip out west with NikCap and Geo-Nat. We had several main goals set for the week - see total solar eclipse, find the oldest caches in NE and KS and find 150+ non traditional caches. We succeeded on all the accounts! That was definitely a week we will remember for the long time. Great times and lots of amazing (and some not so amazing) cache. Thanks for bringing us to this location and thanks for the cache!

      We all learn to spell numbers at an early age, but can you figure
out how to spell these numbers and than organize them into the
needed coordinates to retrieve your prize? We will find out!
Terrain during late spring and summer months may be a bit rough
(like most wilderness park caches). Depending on water level, it
may or may not be easy to grab from below, otherwise you may have
to lay down to retrieve this cache. Please return cache to its home
after signing the log.

      &lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been working on my Multi Fizzy, so I&amp;#39;ve been analyzing the distances to the nearest multis for every D/T combination. &amp;nbsp;Turns out 4.5/1.5 multis are pretty rare--closest is more than 350 miles away in St. Louis! &amp;nbsp;So here is a closer one, but you will be tested to find the coordinates for the second (final) stage. &amp;nbsp;If you need a hint, log your DNF and I&amp;#39;ll send you one. &amp;nbsp;It is a 4.5 difficulty after all!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First stage is a bit unusual--you&amp;#39;ll know it when you see it, but you won&amp;#39;t easily see it. &amp;nbsp;Dimentions are roughly 2&amp;quot; x 3&amp;quot;. &amp;nbsp;Second stage is easy--just a green bison tube.&lt;/p&gt;

        I was with krayzeekidd the first time she came and looked for this.  We absolutely loved stage one!  It was Really tough! I litterly looked at it at least a dozen times and it never registered in my head that it was the cache!  Great job on this one!

        While out in the area grabbing a new series of caches with TwoFingersDown and HuntinTrea$ure, we came out to this one.  TFD confirmed stage 2 was missing, so we replaced (he will contact the CO with information).  Wicked stage 1!  Awesome!  Thanks so much for bringing us here!  I sure am glad to have this one off my list!  LOL!  :)

        An absolutely perfect day to be out doing a few steam caches.  This one and 'Three Little Words' gave me fits for a long long time.  Eventually I was able to find the needed info to solve both and so today was the day to get them.  Just a little bit of difficulty in spotting this one at first, but started over from another direction and this time it put me spot on.  Good puzzle and good cache... Thanks, steam!

      This is a five stage Multi cache. Enjoy the tour.

To find the next stage, use the coordinates at the current stage at which you are for a starting point. You will be unable to jump stages. 

The coordinates above will take you to an intersection.  Then go to N 40 degrees, 46.854 and W 096 degrees, 41.529.  

Upon arrival at Stage 2, locate a plaque which describes some history about this location that I did not know existed.  Enjoy the history lesson.  Determine in what year the man took his first flying lesson at this site.  

Stage 3:  for North coords, from the year at Stage 2, subtract 408.  Add the result; for West coords, from the year at Stage 2, subtract 1473.  Subtract the result.  Upon arrival at stage 3, obtain the two digit number on the tanker cart or side of the building. 

Stage 4:  for North coords, use number obtained at stage 3 and add 340 to it.  Add the result; for West coords, use same number, add one zero on the end, and add 1992 to it.  Subtract the result.  Upon arrival at Stage 4, obtain street address of the building, but do NOT GO ON THE PREMISE.  Use the hint here.

The street address you are seeking is that of the former State Farm and later the Lincoln Public Schools building.  I believe the new Lincoln Public Schools building is going to have a new address so I will just give you the street address:  5901.

Stage 5:  for North coords, use first three digits of street address and add 1196 to it.  Add the result; for West coords, use same three digits and add 2046 to it.  Subtract the result.  Go to Stage 5 and find the cache. 

Good luck.


Congratulations to Krydos for the FTF.

        Happy almost Halloween.  Having signed a challenge cache in New Hampshire earlier this month, I needed two more Multi-caches (U, P) to qualify.  This will also help with a couple of other challenges.  So, having a bit of time today, I headed to Lincoln and Wahoo to "get 'er done."  I was pretty sure I understood the situation and soon had the container in my sights.  Parking was somewhat interesting, as there was more traffic along the final area than I had expected, but no worries, made my way over, SL for this, my #2291 [:D] cache, then headed for the other one...

        Went to Lincoln today for Football Fan Day, so I grabbed a few caches while I was there, including some I needed for challenges.  Very hot to be out. Don't think I had ever been to Bennet and Roca. Nice little towns.   Quite a tour of Lincoln getting all the info for this one. TFTC  5424  12:57:00 PM

        I see that there have been comments over the last several months concerning Stage 1 and Stage 2.

When I was going through the process to submit this cache to the Reviewer for review and to get it published, the Reviewer would not approve it as submitted so the information regarding Stage 1 and Stage 2 had to be edited.  I do not remember exactly what the problem was, but the verbiage as on the cache page at this time is what the Reviewer approved.  The cache was then published.

If this verbiage at Stage 1 and Stage 2 confuses anyone, I suggest that cachers just ignore Stage 1 and start at Stage 2.

The Stage at 59th &amp; "O" Streets was destroyed by fire.  The new LPS building uses a different street number than what was originally at that location.  Thus, I provided the old street address that is needed to get to the next stage.  It is 5901.

I hope that this clarifies some ambiguities about this cache.  Cache on.

        Krayzeekidd and I decided to try this cache out a few nights ago.  The way some of it is worded makes it difficult to decipher and we were confused as to why there was a stage one?  We did enjoy the tour of Lincoln. Also the second stage was really interesting,  neither of us knew it was here so thanks for that.

        Mr. and Mrs. MacFive and the youngest team member were in Lincoln this morning to drop the youngest off at a training.  We found this cache before her training started.  

Yeah!  Easy find once the muggle left.    Right when Mrs. MacFive was heading towards GZ a muggle arrived right next to it.  We patiently waited in the van watching him tie down his  ladder in his truckbed.  Once he left Mrs. MacFive found this lonely cache of 8 months without any problems.  

As a math family we love Pi day and celebrate it every year.

Thanks TwoFingersDown for the cache.

     <groundspeak:long_description html="True">
      Geocaching with kids can range from a simple outing that includes an easy-to-find cache, to multi-step lessons in GPS technology, geography, and map-reading. Many caches are educational in nature (don't tell the kids) and are closely linked to regional history, or geological features. Many caches are hidden by children, for children, making these finds especially appealing. Geocaching is an excellent scouting activity because it includes orienteering and other outdoor skills.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Caches often contain small gifts and toys that are of interest to children. Cache etiquette requires that you place something in the cache if you remove something, so plan to bring along some small items to put in the cache, at least one for each child. Caches also often contain logbooks, so the kids can sign in and leave comments.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I have cached with a few kids, and its always a blast to see their eyes light up with they make the find!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is a series of caches all being letterboxes, none of the hides are tough, just look in the obvious locations. Some of the micro sized containers, do not contain an ink pad, so please bring your own if you choose to stamp. Do not take the stamp or ink pad, they must stay in the container.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;

      The cache is NOT located at the published coordinates--used to be a Blockbuster. Now you'll need to go on NetFlix for the info. I guess I watched too much Monty Python in college--I think it may kill brain cells. That probably explains a lot.

      &lt;p&gt;This will test your trivia knowledge of a classic/notorious/very silly movie. Why it didn't win any Academy Awards, I'll never know, but they did make a Broadway musical out of it a few years ago... Use the answers to the following trivia from Monty Python and the Holy Grail to obtain the final location of the cache. Eight answers are even numbers, and five are odd numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A. Number of horses ridden by King Arthur during the movie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B. Weight (in ounces) of an unlaiden European swallow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C. Number of times that the taunting French are encountered in the movie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;D. Number of mortal wounds King Arthur inflicts upon the Black Knight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;E. Number of flying cows in the movie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;F. Number of heads on the giant encountered by brave Sir Robin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;G. Number of maidens that tempts Sir Galahad in Castle Anthrax (how many live there).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;H. Number of castles built in the swamp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I. Number of knights who say Ni!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J. Number of minstrels that follow brave Sir Robin. I counted the percussionist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;K. Number that King Arthur counts after '2' when throwing the Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;L. Number of horns on the head of Tim the Enchanter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;M. Number of questions that must be answered at The Bridge of Death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;N. Number of knights thrown into The Gorge of Eternal Peril.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As in all important quests, there will be a final test. No longer will you have to open the lock. Your only test is the test of COURAGE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Follow. But. Follow only if ye be men of valour, for the entrance to this cave is guarded by a creature so foul, so cruel that no man yet has fought with it and lived. Bones of full fifty men lie strewn about its lair. So, brave knights, if you do doubt your courage or your strength, come no further, for death awaits you all with nasty, big, pointy teeth."--Tim the Enchanter&lt;/p&gt;

        Holy cow!!! It's really been a year since this was found?  We enjoyed the puzzle, as it's one of our fave movies. We took turns answering the riddles.  J did the honors of entry into the cave.  He didn't want to.  He kept repeating, "Look at the bones, man!" He went almost completely to the end with no cache in sight.  Boo.  After coming back on a sibsequent visit with a holy hand grenade (don't we wish!) &amp; permission from the CO, we placed a new container.  Well, LA did, freaking out the whole way since she was in just a t-shirt &amp; jeans, no gloves, no kneepads or flame thrower for the little spiders or the very big arachnid she bravely crossed under while using only a long pole to move webs ahead of her by flashlight.  Almost left an attachment behind as she started darting wildly out, but smartly looked back just in case before getting too far.  A fave point for everything but the spiders. No purple sharpie, bet it  flooded away last year.  SL TFTC #2719

        When I woke up this morning I certainly didn't think getting a cache like this was on my agenda. However I did need one with at least 10 favorite points for the weekend souvenir and this one fit the bill. 

Love the movie, I can't believe it's taken me so many years to get this smiley! 

And for the next finder, I happened to leave a really nice purple sharpie at ground zero. When I got to the car and realized it I wasn't going back for it!

        We are from NW FL.  A good caching friend up here suggested this cache as one we night like to get.  It looked like a fun one and a good reason to watch the movie again.  It has been years since we saw it.  So we did, and we got some answers.  Then our 16 year old grandson was given the "task" by us to help with those we couldn't answer.  Geo checker kept saying something wrong.  Grandson asked a friend, and we asked our friends (all muggles in Florida)..   still something was wrong.  So an email to the CO,  not for answers but to tell us WHAT WAS WRONG.  Gee only 2 were!  Well, when all else failed we had to contact the CO for help on those 2.  Finally the geochecker was CORRECT!  YIPEE!

We came by here last night and a game was going on, so that meant parents and kids all over.  No way could we approach GZ without being seen.  So early this morning (about 9) we returned. YEAH, no one in site....so M armed himself with what he thought would be needed.  Pretty soon D hears "I got IT".  

We were soon back at our car, happy to have a smiley for this awesome cache.  Gotta give a favorite.  We really did have fun solving it, even though we didn't get all the answers right with out the CO's help.

      Abbott: Well Costello, I'm going to New York with you. You know Bucky Harris, the Yankee's manager, gave me a job as coach for as long as you're on the team.

Costello: Look Abbott, if you're the coach, you must know all the players.

Abbott: I certainly do.

Costello: Well you know I've never met the guys. So you'll have to tell me their names, and then I'll know who's playing on the team.

Abbott: Oh, I'll tell you their names, but you know it seems to me they give these ball players now-a-days very peculiar names.

Costello: You mean funny names?

Abbott: Strange names, pet names...like Dizzy Dean...

Costello: His brother Daffy.

Abbott: Daffy Dean...

Costello: And their French cousin.

Abbott: French?

Costello: Goofè.

Abbott: Goofè Dean. Well, let's see, we have on the bags, Who's on first, What's on second, I Don't Know is on third...

Costello: That's what I want to find out.

Abbott: I say Who's on first, What's on second, I Don't Know's on third.

Costello: Are you the manager?

Abbott: Yes.

Costello: You gonna be the coach too?

Abbott: Yes.

Costello: And you don't know the fellows' names?

Abbott: Well I should.

Costello: Well then who's on first?

Abbott: Yes.

Costello: I mean the fellow's name.

Abbott: Who.

Costello: The guy on first.

Abbott: Who.

Costello: The first baseman.

Abbott: Who.

Costello: The guy playing...

Abbott: Who is on first!

Costello: I'm asking YOU who's on first.

Abbott: That's the man's name.

Costello: That's who's name?

Abbott: Yes.

Costello: Well go ahead and tell me.

Abbott: That's it.

Costello: That's who?

Abbott: Yes.

PAUSE

Costello: Look, you gotta first baseman?

Abbott: Certainly.

Costello: Who's playing first?

Abbott: That's right.

Costello: When you pay off the first baseman every month, who gets the money?

Abbott: Every dollar of it.

Costello: All I'm trying to find out is the fellow's name on first base.

Abbott: Who.

Costello: The guy that gets...

Abbott: That's it.

Costello: Who gets the money...

Abbott: He does, every dollar. Sometimes his wife comes down and collects it.

Costello: Who's wife?

Abbott: Yes.

PAUSE

Abbott: What's wrong with that?

Costello: Look, all I wanna know is when you sign up the first baseman, how does he sign his name?

Abbott: Who.

Costello: The guy.

Abbott: Who.

Costello: How does he sign...

Abbott: That's how he signs it.

Costello: Who?

Abbott: Yes.

PAUSE

Costello: All I'm trying to find out is what's the guy's name on first base.

Abbott: No. What is on second base.

Costello: I'm not asking you who's on second.

Abbott: Who's on first.

Costello: One base at a time!

Abbott: Well, don't change the players around.

Costello: I'm not changing nobody!

Abbott: Take it easy, buddy.

Costello: I'm only asking you, who's the guy on first base?

Abbott: That's right.

Costello: Ok.

Abbott: All right.

PAUSE

Costello: What's the guy's name on first base?

Abbott: No. What is on second.

Costello: I'm not asking you who's on second.

Abbott: Who's on first.

Costello: I don't know.

Abbott: He's on third, we're not talking about him.

Costello: Now how did I get on third base?

Abbott: Why you mentioned his name.

Costello: If I mentioned the third baseman's name, who did I say is playing third?

Abbott: No. Who's playing first.

Costello: What's on first?

Abbott: What's on second.

Costello: I don't know.

Abbott: He's on third.

Costello: There I go, back on third again!

PAUSE

Costello: Would you just stay on third base and don't go off it.

Abbott: All right, what do you want to know?

Costello: Now who's playing third base?

Abbott: Why do you insist on putting Who on third base?

Costello: What am I putting on third.

Abbott: No. What is on second.

Costello: You don't want who on second?

Abbott: Who is on first.

Costello: I don't know.

Abbott &amp; Costello Together:Third base!

PAUSE

Costello: Look, you gotta outfield?

Abbott: Sure.

Costello: The left fielder's name?

Abbott: Why.

Costello: I just thought I'd ask you.

Abbott: Well, I just thought I'd tell ya.

Costello: Then tell me who's playing left field.

Abbott: Who's playing first.

Costello: I'm not... stay out of the infield! I want to know what's the guy's name in left field?

Abbott: No, What is on second.

Costello: I'm not asking you who's on second.

Abbott: Who's on first!

Costello: I don't know.

Abbott &amp; Costello Together: Third base!

PAUSE

Costello: The left fielder's name?

Abbott: Why.

Costello: Because!

Abbott: Oh, he's centerfield.

PAUSE

Costello: Look, You gotta pitcher on this team?

Abbott: Sure.

Costello: The pitcher's name?

Abbott: Tomorrow.

Costello: You don't want to tell me today?

Abbott: I'm telling you now.

Costello: Then go ahead.

Abbott: Tomorrow!

Costello: What time?

Abbott: What time what?

Costello: What time tomorrow are you gonna tell me who's pitching?

Abbott: Now listen. Who is not pitching.

Costello: I'll break your arm, you say who's on first! I want to know what's the pitcher's name?

Abbott: What's on second.

Costello: I don't know.

Abbott &amp; Costello Together: Third base!

PAUSE

Costello: Gotta a catcher?

Abbott: Certainly.

Costello: The catcher's name?

Abbott: Today.

Costello: Today, and tomorrow's pitching.

Abbott: Now you've got it.

Costello: All we got is a couple of days on the team.

PAUSE

Costello: You know I'm a catcher too.

Abbott: So they tell me.

Costello: I get behind the plate to do some fancy catching, Tomorrow's pitching on my team and a heavy hitter gets up. Now the heavy hitter bunts the ball. When he bunts the ball, me, being a good catcher, I'm gonna throw the guy out at first base. So I pick up the ball and throw it to who?

Abbott: Now that's the first thing you've said right.

Costello: I don't even know what I'm talking about!

PAUSE

Abbott: That's all you have to do.

Costello: Is to throw the ball to first base.

Abbott: Yes!

Costello: Now who's got it?

Abbott: Naturally.

PAUSE

Costello: Look, if I throw the ball to first base, somebody's gotta get it. Now who has it?

Abbott: Naturally.

Costello: Who?

Abbott: Naturally.

Costello: Naturally?

Abbott: Naturally.

Costello: So I pick up the ball and I throw it to Naturally.

Abbott: No you don't, you throw the ball to Who.

Costello: Naturally.

Abbott: That's different.

Costello: That's what I said.

Abbott: You're not saying it...

Costello: I throw the ball to Naturally.

Abbott: You throw it to Who.

Costello: Naturally.

Abbott: That's it.

Costello: That's what I said!

Abbott: You ask me.

Costello: I throw the ball to who?

Abbott: Naturally.

Costello: Now you ask me.

Abbott: You throw the ball to Who?

Costello: Naturally.

Abbott: That's it.

Costello: Same as you! Same as YOU! I throw the ball to who. Whoever it is drops the ball and the guy runs to second. Who picks up the ball and throws it to What. What throws it to I Don't Know. I Don't Know throws it back to Tomorrow, Triple play. Another guy gets up and hits a long fly ball to Because. Why? I don't know! He's on third and I don't give a darn!

Abbott: What?

Costello: I said I don't give a darn!

Abbott: Oh, that's our shortstop.

Costello:  Ok fine, who's in right field?

Abbott: No who's on first, nobody's in right field.

Costello: You don't have a right field?

Abbott: Sure we do.

Costello: Ok what's his name?

Abbott: No, What's on second.

Costello: Do you have any bench players?

Abbott: Yep, yesterday.

Costello: You had a bench player yesterday but who do you have today.

Abbott: No, who's on first and today's catching.

Costello: *shrugs shoulders and leaves confused*


Could you imagine being the announcer at one of these games?  It could get so confusing.  I can see it now.

Announcer:  Welcome to stadium today.  It should be a great game today......

Announcer:  Here we are bottom of the 4th with zero outs.  The ball is hit sharply to what.  He tosses it to yesterday.  He throws it to I don't know and he throws it back to yesterday.  Yesterday fires it over to tomorrow, he fires it to today, and he tosses it to why for the triple play.  That was sure a crazy play.......

Announcer:  Welcome back folks.  We are in the bottom of the 9th inning.  Games on the line with one out.  The balls hit deep but right a nobody.  He makes the catch and toss it back in to I don't give a darn.  He fires to what and he tosses to yesterday.  Yesterday throws it to I don't know and he gets confused and throws it to himself and then to because for the double play.

These plays are sure confusing but at least we won the game.  Thanks for tuning in folks.  Don't miss the game tomorrow.  Should be a great game.

      Coordinates are for my secret lab on East Campus, which was unfortunately sucked into an alternate reality with my trusty lab assistant, John Dalton, during the synthesis of Unobtainium, so don't bother looking for it at the published coordinates!
     </groundspeak:short_description>
     <groundspeak:long_description html="True">
      &lt;p&gt;My training was in chemistry and microbiology, but most of you know me for my work with particularly 'stinky' compounds (and caches). This is the latest stinker that I've managed to synthesize. I discovered the secret to making Unobtainium by combining two very unusual molecules (Confoundium and Discouraginium). It's nearly impossible to synthesize the precursors, since one must use only the second most common isotopes for their synthesis. I also used cold fusion (yielding 1.21 Gigawatts of power) through a flux capacitor to catalyze the reaction, but anything else producing that kind of power should be OK too. Be careful when you make it, since a tremendous amount of hot gas is usually produced! If you don't get it just right, you almost always end up with 100% pure bolognium (and nearly a thousand times as much hot air). Since unobtainium is particularly rare (it's worth more than million times it's weight in gold), I've had to hide it in a particularly difficult to reach spot. Keen eyes should spot it on the first trip to GZ, but more prudent cachers will need to formulate a plan to actually sign the log on their next attempt. So what's it used for? I think it would make an excellent floor wax AND a dessert topping! If you log a find, add your ideas to your log, and I'll try and update the list of 'uses'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may be tempted to cross train tracks to reach this cache. Recent encounters between geocachers, trains, and law enforcement compel me to tell you to FIND AN ALTERNATE ROUTE! You can get to GZ in a perfectly acceptable manner, but it will require a little longer trip. Be smart, STAY SAFE, and obey the law!&lt;/p&gt;

      The molecular diameter of the unobtanium is roughly 100,000,000 angstroms, and it is contained in rust-brown containment vessel.  Be sure to use five decimal places in your calculation.  Weighty stuff, huh!

        HOORAH!  Together with Tracker1944 we made the next to impossible grab this afternoon on our first attempt!  The CO has requested suggested uses for Unobtanium.  I did not want to suggest anything, I wanted to actually test the formula and offer a real tried and true use.  Please note that I had a falling out with Chemistry as a child due to almost blowing up my bedroom when I was 12.  I was the proud owner of a GILBERT Super Atomic Chemistry Set.  That's another story.  My path turned from Science to figuring out people problems ...  I went into Psychology (hence my GeoName, gyouareyou; i.e. GURU).  Anyway I digress.  I went to the attic and retrieved my Gilbert Chem Set and started to work following the given formulas.  I had every element required and began combining them when I had the idea to heat the reagents up with the help of my old Bunsen Burner.  When I reached a safe boiling point, Confoundium and Discouraginium vaporized into a iridescent glow.  The resulting gas was quite enticing to breathe in.  Soon I reached a state of euphoria and began having flash backs of every cache I'd ever found and some of the more traumatic 5/5s where my life was at various levels of risk.  Suddenly I had a sensation of heightened accomplishment and quest for adventure.  The result of combining these two Chemical states was beyond words, mind altering to say the least, spontaneous reactants synthesizing in metabolic quantum unexpectium .  The result is a new use, which when catalyzed at just the right moment creates a state of what I will call GEOMADNESS.  WHAT SHOULD I CALL THIS NEW SENSATION?  ... why GURUNIUM47  of course ... a highly crystallized isotopian vapor when breathed in creates the lasting  belief in yourself to conquer any geocache anytime anywhere. btw ... when you cool this vapor back to a liquid you get an excellent floor wax, but not very tasty on ice cream or apple pie.
P.S. Being careful not to post a spoiler, I made the grab with my Roy Rogers Nose Ring in place hooked up to my amazing Captain Video  laser grabber.  It was the perfect TOTT to get Unobtainium.

      &lt;p&gt;TOTTs - Tools of the trade. Some people love 'em, some people hate 'em. But no matter what your opinion is, totts have become a part of the game. This is a multi cache that you will need extra tools for. If your totts are limited to your gps and a pen then move along, there's nothing for you here.&lt;/p&gt;
     </groundspeak:short_description>
     <groundspeak:long_description html="True">
      &lt;p&gt;"What is a tott?" That is one of the most common questions from new cachers. Totts come in all shapes and sizes. The essential totts are the most basic needed for geocaching. A gps device or smartphone can lead you to a cache and a writing utensil can sign the log. That is the basics, the essence of geocaching in it's most basic form. But what if you need a little something extra to get the log signed? Can't get the log out of the container? Tweezers are a perfect tott for that. You can't quite reach the cache? Try a ladder if you are veritcally challenged. You can't reach the cache without getting wet? Throw on some irrigation boots, hip waders, or better yet get in a kayak. Tools of the trade can be as simple as a stick for poking the cache through a hole or as complex as climbing gear to repel down the side of a cliff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When my friends and I go on a caching trip we usually have a van foll of totts. Bikes, ladders, boots, poles, magnets, flashlights, and anything else we can think of. We never use everything, but very rarely do we come across a situation we are unprepared for. Don't worry, I hear the grumbling as some of you read this... "I don't want to drag a bunch of stuff around to go caching!" I've heard it all before, and the great news is that there are thousands of caches around you that you don't need any extra tools to sign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You won't need a lot of extra equipment here, but you will have to have the correct tools. So get after it, a smiley is waiting for you as long as you sign the log!&lt;br /&gt;

      I was out placing some challenge caches at Twin Lakes west of Lincoln.  It was late, but I thought with the moon rising I'd have plenty of light to hide the final cache.  Unfortunately I quickly realized that was no moon...

The rest is just a jumble in my mind.  My body being lifted into the air, strange lights and sounds, the smell of a cigar, a name..Zoidberg I think, and the feeling of crab-like pinchers holding me down. 

I remember some sort of struggle and running down a ramp into the woods.  I think I hit my head on a low branch and blacked out.

When I awoke, I was sore all over, but I noticed these three chips implanted under my skin.  This was ALIEN, and it felt like there was a strange whispering in my skull.  Luckily I was not far from the cache mobile where I have may useful TOTTs.  When I got there, I fashioned a hat for my head made of aluminum foil--that cut down the sound in my head so I could think.  I then dug out a small chip that hummed and crackled with energy.  I immediately broke it to keep it from signalling my whereabouts.  I have no idea how to interpret the symbols on them.  Are they the key to a greater intelligence?  A star-map of the universe?  Or a warning...

If you can decode these I think it may lead to something wonderful (or at least interesting).  Please let me know if you decode this.  I am concerned and feel that I'm being watched.

If you find it helpful, you may want to make your own aluminum hat to block out signals.

        We're on a mission to complete our Nebraska fizzy and our 25x fizzy. This is our last cache of our adventure. It completes a tough grid filler for us. If not for a helping hand in solving the puzzle we wouldn't be here finding golf balls. Ten yellow range balls to be exact, and one tennis ball too! We really thought this was going to be a dnf. Gary went back for his gloves and seached for a while without success. When I finally got back into the proper game I hollered, I see it! Gary made the grab and signed us in. Where the heck is the golf range anyhow? Thank you for the grid filler and the fun!

        So I'm usually never the one that logs the cache this late.... Especially for my last square needed to fill my first fizzy!! But as usual life got in the way.. So back to the original task at hand, Krayzeekidd, Huntintrea$ure and myself decided this last winter we should try to start getting these last few caches we needed to fill our fizzy. KK was pretty close all ready but Ht and I still needed 20 or so.. So we slowly but surely started getting all those hard ones we never grabbed before. Again life got in the way and I slowed everyone down, But the other two were patient with me and we eventually were able to complete the goal. We knew all along that we were saving this one for our final. I had one other left before this one to grab and the closest D/T that i needed was norfolk so we planned a road trip that way to grab some up there (amazing caches there) and then it brings us to today ( not today but like a month ago ;) ) and we grabbed this one finally!! I loved this puzzle and had a blast figuring it all out! Very cleaver!! Thanks so much!!

        This was the last cache I needed to fill my 1st fizzy grid!  And what a fun one it was!  The puzzle was awesome once I figured out what to do!  The hide itself was great too!  This was a team effort with HuntinTrea$ure and volkswagenphreak since it was their last cache for their 1st fizzy as well!  So fun!  We have had this planned for months and today was finally the day to make it happen!  We did have to replace the container.  I will attach pictures of the old one.  It had been chewed and was filled with water.  :(  Thank you so much for bringing us here for this milestone!  We had a great time!  Favorite point from me!  :D

I appreciate you hiding and maintaining Just Out of This World.

Out caching with 2FD, VW and KK.

This cache was the culmination of lots if hard work! This cache is where KK, VW, and I completed our first fizzy! 2FD joined us for the celebration and helped us mark the occasion with a special coin! I am thankful for great friends that have helped me learn along the way and have been there to encourage and guide me.. i enjoy giving back to others in this great hobby as well!
Thank you!

        This one was a fun one!  Kk and I thought we would grab the first stage one night and just grab the rest when we were close to them,  but we ended up getting almost finished with all of it in one night.  There was one part we just couldn't see in the dark.  But when we came back in the daylight boom there it was!  Lots of cool places were visited!  Thank you!

      A three stage multi with just under a mile round trip walk.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
First stage, you will have to figure out a way to retrieve the magnetic hide a key, it will be obvious once you get to GZ.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Once you retrieve the container at stage 1, it contains the coordinates to the second stage where you will find a camo'd pill bottle. Should be an easy grab here as well.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Stage 3 - You will be searching for a large ammo can, I filled it with a few items, please if you take something, replace it with something with equal or greater value.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Please return the hides in the same way as you found them. Good luck and enjoy!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Update - this is closest large size multi cache within 160 miles, and the only one in the state of Nebraska, come find it!

        It's a good thing when you are camping you bring a lot of gear! It took 3 trips back to the car to get all the tools together to get the 1st stage stage. 2nd stage is cute and the final took a bit of circling before finally finding it. All in good shape. Thanks!

        So this morning TheGeneral1004 and I head over here before leaving town. Not clearly thinking ahead we head down the trail. About 3/4 of the way to stage one we spot the container. Back to the truck for a TOTT. I thought for sure it would do the trick. Nope. Back to the truck for more stuff. Grab a second TOTT. MacGuyver it together. Still not quite right. Back for a 3rd TOTT. Finally able to head down to stage 2. Didn't realize stage 2 was a little different than the description. Cute stage 2. Found after a short search. Headed for the final. TG1004 spotted it from 30' away. And he kept telling me earlier how his eyes are changing for the worse. I don't think so. It certainly turned into a little adventure. It was our last cache in the area before heading back to Sioux Falls. TFTC. SL.

      Many of us vividly remember the important and sometimes tragic days that we have experienced.  Things like JFK being shot, Neil and Buzz landing on the moon, the Challenger explosion, and the Oklahoma City bombing. 

This cache is dedicated to one of those days, 9/11.  While in a local cemetery I noticed a 9/11 memorial and wanted to place a cache dealing with it somehow.  Since virtual caches are no longer allowed this was the next best thing.

In your logs please post your memories of that day.
  
My memories are of driving to Seward, NE for class that day and I was just outside of York, NE when the first announcement came over that radio that a plane had hit the first building.  At first everyone was thinking it was an accident and no one really understood the impact it would have on our country until the second plane hit.  At that point I think everyone realized we were under attack.  I don't remember much else during the day, except that everywhere you turned there was a TV on and people gathered around watching the news and praying.  I remember thinking what now and how do we respond to this attack.  Not everyone agrees with our tactics but some kind of justice needed to happen for those responsible.

The other memory I have is paying $6.25 a gallon for gas on the way home that night.  I guess that’s what I get for always having my vehicle on E.

At the listed coordinates is the memorial.  When walking up to it there is an engraved stone with a date and a quote from President G.W Bush.  You will need information from that stone to get the final coordinates.  You will be looking for a nano at the final location. 

For the north coordinate take the numerical value for the month squared and subtract that number from the original north coordinate.

For the west coordinate take the last digit of the year on the stone and add it to the original west coordinate

        We are on our way home to Minnesota. We had to stop in Nebraska for the evening and plan to grab a few caches in the morning. Our goal is to get a dozen. We couldn't drive into the cemetery and almost left, but spotted a way to walk in. After correcting a bit of bad math, we were able to get our names on the log. TFTC SL

        I was homeschooled that year, and my dad called my mom as he had been listening to the radio going to work and was turning around to come home. We turned on the TV and watched the 2nd tower get hit. I’ll never forget. May we all treat each other well and work toward this never happening again.

        I remember this day very well.  I was at work and had a sick feeling in my stomach as a couple of family members frequently worked in NYC.  I immediately called other family members and they confirmed that they were both home and safe.  Both had been there the previous week.  

A co-worker had to run a deposit to the bank shortly after the tragedy was reported.  She was very shaken up when she returned.  By then, all air traffic had been suspended/grounded.  She said that as she was driving, she saw an airplane shadow over her vehicle and heard it.  It turned out that it was Air Force One heading to Offut Air Force base.  It really shook her as it might have anyone.

Thanks for brining me to this nice memorial.

        Thanksgiving weekend and I am heading west to Omaha.  Todays goal was to grab some earth caches, virtuals and county oldies.
A really nice memorial.  As for the cache, it took a really long time before I finally located it.
Thanks placing this cache for me to find!

      &lt;b&gt;Jogging&lt;/b&gt; is a form of trotting or running at a slow or leisurely pace. The main intention is to increase physical fitness with less stress on the body than from faster running.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Isn't it the worst, when you are along a bike trail, in the woods searching for a cache, you find it, log it, put it back, and come out of the woods to get back on the trail, right as a jogger runs by, UGH!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is a series of caches all being letterboxes, none of the hides are tough, just look in the obvious locations. Some of the micro sized containers, do not contain an ink pad, so please bring your own if you choose to stamp. Do not take the stamp or ink pad, they must stay in the container.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;

        Our home base is Ottawa, Ontario. We're doing a road trip starting and ending in St. Louis that will hit 8 states (some only briefly), pausing along the way to view the total solar eclipse in Alliance, Nebraska (which we did - it was great!). We're targeting challenge caches, virtuals and other oldies, and various others of interest, mostly non-traditionals.

We had the full day to spend in the Lincoln area today, and after hitting the OCCT in the morning, we had the afternoon free.  Being partial to wherigos (we own several back home), this series really attracted our interest.  We contacted the CO before arriving in the area, to see if he would like us to replace any that are missing, but that turned out to be unnecessary.  We never expected to do them all, but they went quite smoothly, and by the end of a long afternoon, we had run the table from A to Z... not necessarily in alphabetical order, but that's the way we'll log them.  Most were quick and easy finds, though a few of the higher-terrain ones were a bit challenging.  Thanks for all the WIG fun!

        Beginning of epic trip out west with NikCap and Geo-Nat. We had several main goals set for the week - see total solar eclipse, find the oldest caches in NE and KS and find 150+ non traditional caches. We succeeded on all the accounts! That was definitely a week we will remember for the long time. Great times and lots of amazing (and some not so amazing) cache. Thanks for bringing us to this location and thanks for the cache!

      "In plain sight" is referring to something being in front of you without any type of obstructions blocking sight of it. Some caches can be so well camo'd they can be hidden like this, i.e. a bird house, or a electric cover.&lt;br /&gt;

Do not take the stamp or ink pad, they must stay in the container.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;

        Visiting from Colorado on my way to a mega event in MN. This is my second time here to get the many wherigos, challenges, and letterboxes in this area.

Since the cartridge doesn't save the coordinates of the final, I solved all of them while saving the final coords into another GPS.  I didn't find all of the containers, but the cold and wind didn't help.  I'm sure I'll be able to find the rest of the series next time I'm here.

Thanks for putting out this series!

        Our home base is Ottawa, Ontario. We're doing a road trip starting and ending in St. Louis that will hit 8 states (some only briefly), pausing along the way to view the total solar eclipse in Alliance, Nebraska (which we did - it was great!). We're targeting challenge caches, virtuals and other oldies, and various others of interest, mostly non-traditionals.

We had the full day to spend in the Lincoln area today, and after hitting the OCCT in the morning, we had the afternoon free.  Being partial to wherigos (we own several back home), this series really attracted our interest.  We contacted the CO before arriving in the area, to see if he would like us to replace any that are missing, but that turned out to be unnecessary.  We never expected to do them all, but they went quite smoothly, and by the end of a long afternoon, we had run the table from A to Z... not necessarily in alphabetical order, but that's the way we'll log them.  Most were quick and easy finds, though a few of the higher-terrain ones were a bit challenging.  Thanks for all the WIG fun!

        Beginning of epic trip out west with NikCap and Geo-Nat. We had several main goals set for the week - see total solar eclipse, find the oldest caches in NE and KS and find 150+ non traditional caches. We succeeded on all the accounts! That was definitely a week we will remember for the long time. Great times and lots of amazing (and some not so amazing) cache. Thanks for bringing us to this location and thanks for the cache!

        On our quest to gather up even more non-traditional caches on our Nebraska/Kansas eclipse geocaching adventure, Jo.Cap and I headed out for the series of Wherigos.  The quizzes were fun to play and Geo-Nat provided us with the answers. Since the final were out of sequence, it is hard to recall if this one gave use trouble or not, but for the most part the coordinates were dead on.
Thanks for the series!

        Fun little multi, nice little park! Geokid and I were in Lincoln for a b-day party and decided this sounded like a kid-friendly multi. Counted, crunched a few numbers, took a little walk, and had the cache in hand in short order. Not the type of hide I'd expected - very clever! TN, dropped TB. I don't normally drop TBs in multi caches, but I figured this one probably gets found fairly often. FP awarded for clever hide. SL, TFTC!

        Our home base is Ottawa, Ontario. We're doing a road trip starting and ending in St. Louis that will hit 8 states (some only briefly), pausing along the way to view the total solar eclipse in Alliance, Nebraska (which we did - it was great!). We're targeting challenge caches, virtuals and other oldies, and various others of interest, mostly non-traditionals.

We had the full day to spend in the Lincoln area today, and after hitting the OCCT in the morning, we had the afternoon free.  Being partial to wherigos (we own several back home), this series really attracted our interest.  We contacted the CO before arriving in the area, to see if he would like us to replace any that are missing, but that turned out to be unnecessary.  We never expected to do them all, but they went quite smoothly, and by the end of a long afternoon, we had run the table from A to Z... not necessarily in alphabetical order, but that's the way we'll log them.  Most were quick and easy finds, though a few of the higher-terrain ones were a bit challenging.  Thanks for all the WIG fun!

        Beginning of epic trip out west with NikCap and Geo-Nat. We had several main goals set for the week - see total solar eclipse, find the oldest caches in NE and KS and find 150+ non traditional caches. We succeeded on all the accounts! That was definitely a week we will remember for the long time. Great times and lots of amazing (and some not so amazing) cache. Thanks for bringing us to this location and thanks for the cache!

Since it is a hideout, it wouldn't be right to just give the location. Once you crack the code you
will find the hideout.

        After completing a multi in Lincoln today, Monty12, nemik53, BTCO Cachers and I spent the afternoon working off a few more caches before heading home. Using the hint we proceeded to the suggested location.  While there we cracked the secret code and then headed for the hideout.  No one was there at the time, so we hung around for a bit, but Mo never did show up.  We finally gave up waiting for him, so we signed the visitor’s log in his hideout and headed on down the road.  We never did figure out what 396 in the hint update had to do with anything. TFTC.  SL.

        An absolutely perfect day to be out doing a few steam caches.  This one and 'Are you Driven?' gave me fits for a long long time.  Eventually I was able to find the needed info to solve both and so today was the day to get them.  Took just a little bit to make the find on this one, but easy to spot from the right location.    Good puzzle and good cache... Thanks, steam!

        Visiting from Colorado.  This is my second time here to get the many wherigos, challenges, and letterboxes in this area.  

Since the cartridge doesn't save the coordinates of the final, I solved all of them while saving the final coords into another GPS.  There is one resident up there who started following me in her car everywhere as I was trying to get them at night.

After resuming the search at daylight, I didn't find all of the containers, but the cold and wind didn't help.  Many of these are not snow friendly.  One was semi-plowed under by someone cutting the overgrowth near the road.   I'm sure I'll be able to find the rest of the series next time I'm here.

        Our home base is Ottawa, Ontario. We're doing a road trip starting and ending in St. Louis that will hit 8 states (some only briefly), pausing along the way to view the total solar eclipse in Alliance, Nebraska (which we did - it was great!). We're targeting challenge caches, virtuals and other oldies, and various others of interest, mostly non-traditionals.

We had the full day to spend in the Lincoln area today, and after hitting the OCCT in the morning, we had the afternoon free.  Being partial to wherigos (we own several back home), this series really attracted our interest.  We contacted the CO before arriving in the area, to see if he would like us to replace any that are missing, but that turned out to be unnecessary.  We never expected to do them all, but they went quite smoothly, and by the end of a long afternoon, we had run the table from A to Z... not necessarily in alphabetical order, but that's the way we'll log them.  Most were quick and easy finds, though a few of the higher-terrain ones were a bit challenging.  Thanks for all the WIG fun!

        Beginning of epic trip out west with NikCap and Geo-Nat. We had several main goals set for the week - see total solar eclipse, find the oldest caches in NE and KS and find 150+ non traditional caches. We succeeded on all the accounts! That was definitely a week we will remember for the long time. Great times and lots of amazing (and some not so amazing) cache. Thanks for bringing us to this location and thanks for the cache!

        On our quest to gather up even more non-traditional caches on our Nebraska/Kansas eclipse geocaching adventure, Jo.Cap and I headed out for the series of Wherigos.  The quizzes were fun to play and Geo-Nat provided us with the answers. Since the final were out of sequence, it is hard to recall if this one gave use trouble or not, but for the most part the coordinates were dead on.
Thanks for the series!

      &lt;p&gt;Let's take a tour of a section of Beal Slough. This is a 5-stage multi cache. It requires a long walk through a primitive wooded area. I didn't find any shortcuts. Each of the first four stages will give you coordinates to the next stage. Please notice the attributes. Depending on the time of year, this could be easier or harder than the D/T rating. Look out for "flying saucers" and the muggles that launch them. Bring your own writing instrument.&lt;/p&gt;

        Almost managed to gather a team from the pre soup event to complete this cache, but the Lincolnites decided not to with the likelihood of mud &amp; slickery.  So we did it ourselves.  At least they helped us properly pronounce it as Beel Sloo.  Luckily we travel as a team regardless or this would've taken a LOT longer!  Found all stages relatively quickly minus one in the middle somewhere that we almost abandoned because it was getting late.  Met up with our caching buddy near the end who helped us find a straighter path back. Favorite point. SL TFTC #2025

        This was the only cartridge that I had trouble running.  It was the first one that I attempted.  I feared that there was some compatibility issue with my iPhone.  So, I went to the next Wherigo and successfully ran the cartridge.  So, I deleted the "E" cartridge, then downloaded it again.  That did the trick, it worked like a charm.

This was one of the last solved locations that I visited today.  Wow, the terrain was very tough compared to the rest of the caches that I found on this day.  The condition of the road was perfect for me today.  After signing the log, I carefully returned to the road and got into my car.  Thanks for the cache.

        Visiting from Colorado. Stopped by here on my way back home to pick up more of the wherigo series, along with challenges and letterboxes.

        Our home base is Ottawa, Ontario. We're doing a road trip starting and ending in St. Louis that will hit 8 states (some only briefly), pausing along the way to view the total solar eclipse in Alliance, Nebraska (which we did - it was great!). We're targeting challenge caches, virtuals and other oldies, and various others of interest, mostly non-traditionals.

We had the full day to spend in the Lincoln area today, and after hitting the OCCT in the morning, we had the afternoon free.  Being partial to wherigos (we own several back home), this series really attracted our interest.  We contacted the CO before arriving in the area, to see if he would like us to replace any that are missing, but that turned out to be unnecessary.  We never expected to do them all, but they went quite smoothly, and by the end of a long afternoon, we had run the table from A to Z... not necessarily in alphabetical order, but that's the way we'll log them.  Most were quick and easy finds, though a few of the higher-terrain ones were a bit challenging.  Thanks for all the WIG fun!

        J&amp;LA called me to say she could not find this one at first. She told me where she was standing and I immediately thought of the cache J&amp;LA owns. She took a look see and sure enough it was. Of course I coaxed her to finishing this cache. I got here COORDS for the (just in case) 911 call, and off she went.  She faced her fears and triumphed! And although she says I would run like a little girl... (WRONG!)  I still like her.   SL  TFTC...  :-)

        The "F" cartridge was the first one in this series that I was able to successfully run.  I knew the answers, spelling them correctly to earn the final coordinates.

At the final, the road conditions were perfect for my car.  I was able to drive so close to the coordinates that I saw the container before I left the car.

Thanks for these caches.  I will need to do more the next time that I come to Lincoln.  Now, time to head home.  I hope to find a few more caches on the way.

        Beginning of epic trip out west with NikCap and Geo-Nat. We had several main goals set for the week - see total solar eclipse, find the oldest caches in NE and KS and find 150+ non traditional caches. We succeeded on all the accounts! That was definitely a week we will remember for the long time. Great times and lots of amazing (and some not so amazing) cache. Thanks for bringing us to this location and thanks for the cache!

        On our quest to gather up even more non-traditional caches on our Nebraska/Kansas eclipse geocaching adventure, Jo.Cap and I headed out for the series of Wherigos.  The quizzes were fun to play and Geo-Nat provided us with the answers. Since the final were out of sequence, it is hard to recall if this one gave use trouble or not, but for the most part the coordinates were dead on.
Thanks for the series!

      &lt;center&gt;&lt;font color="red"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BLOODY MARY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you ever heard of a woman by the name of Mary Partington? She's quite the legend here in Lincoln, Nebraska. Mary is often referred to as "Bloody Mary"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She once lived very close to where you are currently standing, If you are reading this from the first stage. This area in the 50's was outside of Lincoln city limits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She lived alone in a house that was quite run down, She had no electricity or curtains on the windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was a retired school teacher, and from what I have heard she wasn't liked by a lot of the students. She was harassed and bothered almost constantly at her house by kids in the area. They would sneak on to her property, try to break in and just cause havoc in her life. I guess she almost never had glass in the windows because once she would replace them, someone else would come along and break them again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mary had pet goats, She loved her goats like they were her children and when they would die she would bury them in her goat cemetery. The local folks thought this was very strange of her and they would torment her about her goats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One October night in 1966 a man was trying to get into Mary's house through her kitchen window. Mary called the Sheriff to let them know she had an intruder but they were at least 15 minutes away still. When the authorities arrived the man was laying face up in the front lawn under the kitchen window dead, with a huge hole where his face once was. Mary shot him. She was never charged with his death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About ten years later she finally moved out of her house, into town. Her house was ransacked for anything and everything and was eventually burned down by three boys who were playing with matches. To this day they still claim it was an accident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mary passed away in June of 1979, She may be gone but her legend will live on forever. If you go to the exact location her house once stood its surrounded by a forest of trees, but the small portion of land where her house stood is still open. No trees grow there just grass, After 40 years its just grass. You can also walk behind that area and there is a dip in the ground where her pond once stood as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have fun finding this cache. You can find it during the day but it would be more fun if you went at night time, especially the last stage, it will stand out to you at night time. Please replace it just like how you found it. This will take you on a bit of a drive, so be prepared for that :)&lt;/p&gt;

        In town for pre-MOGA event. We are a group of five: kevins2betsey, roy&amp;annette and peachy1276. Logs are signed TJC.  today we are focusing on mysteries solved, non-traditionals and/or high favorite  points.  This cache gets a favorite. I would give it more than one if I could.  Longest multi we've done.  Struggled three times with one stage.  CO was very helpful when she learned off our struggle.  Really neat cache container. And maybe best of all was the history behind the cache!

        Kevins2betsey dragged me out of the hotel last night to get this cache. We got stuck at stage 3. Came back in the morning with roy&amp;annette to see if 4 more eyes would do the trick, but still couldn't couldn't find the container. After messaging with the CO, we were able to move on the final. I'm glad we didn't have to leave town without it. Signed log as TJC for Topeka/Junction City. Thanks for the adventure.

        Out with halllilley for some caching.  This was the last stop for the day.  We started it with nemik53 a few weeks ago, halllilley finished it last week, and I did it today.  I agree, it would be much better at night.  Maybe the next time I'm out there at night (fat chance) I will stop by and see how it looks. Alot of driving, but, still a fun cache and interesting story.  A fav point.

For the North subtract 1645  from the year that will give the ABC. To get the West use the same year from the arch Subtract 1235 that will get you XYZ.&lt;/p&gt;

        Visiting from Colorado.  This is my second time here to get the many wherigos, challenges, and letterboxes in this area.  

Since the cartridge doesn't save the coordinates of the final, I solved all of them while saving the final coords into another GPS.  There is one resident up there who started following me in her car everywhere as I was trying to get them at night.

After resuming the search at daylight, I didn't find all of the containers, but the cold and wind didn't help.  Many of these are not snow friendly.  One was semi-plowed under by someone cutting the overgrowth near the road.   I'm sure I'll be able to find the rest of the series next time I'm here.

        Our home base is Ottawa, Ontario. We're doing a road trip starting and ending in St. Louis that will hit 8 states (some only briefly), pausing along the way to view the total solar eclipse in Alliance, Nebraska (which we did - it was great!). We're targeting challenge caches, virtuals and other oldies, and various others of interest, mostly non-traditionals.

We had the full day to spend in the Lincoln area today, and after hitting the OCCT in the morning, we had the afternoon free.  Being partial to wherigos (we own several back home), this series really attracted our interest.  We contacted the CO before arriving in the area, to see if he would like us to replace any that are missing, but that turned out to be unnecessary.  We never expected to do them all, but they went quite smoothly, and by the end of a long afternoon, we had run the table from A to Z... not necessarily in alphabetical order, but that's the way we'll log them.  Most were quick and easy finds, though a few of the higher-terrain ones were a bit challenging.  Thanks for all the WIG fun!

        Beginning of epic trip out west with NikCap and Geo-Nat. We had several main goals set for the week - see total solar eclipse, find the oldest caches in NE and KS and find 150+ non traditional caches. We succeeded on all the accounts! That was definitely a week we will remember for the long time. Great times and lots of amazing (and some not so amazing) cache. Thanks for bringing us to this location and thanks for the cache!

      This should be a fairly simple two stage multi. 

First Stage will take you to a stone with some information about the park. Read this sign to get the needed information to get you to the second and final stage.

      To get the North coords, find the first digit of the year that Stephen graduated from any one of the three schools. Subract that number from the North Coordinates.

To get the West Coordinates, take the number of developments, and add 127 to it, this will give you the west coordinates - 096 40.ABC

You will be looking for a nano, its quite a reach. There are moveable items in the area that may help you make the grab.

        On an overcast day, it was still a beautiful day to find a cache or two. Sammalamma and I, met with J&amp;LA, and Jimmy63, to help scope out this little teaser. We found what we were looking for, signed the log, and we were on our way to get Sammalamma to her viewing of the play, "Mary Poppins",at Lincoln Southwest......while I head out for some competitive soup......Tftc!

      'O' street and its adjoining highways may or may not be the longest stretch of straight road in the world. but that wont stop us from making this series of caches!  A set of 3, two regular caches and a mystery bonus.
     </groundspeak:short_description>
     <groundspeak:long_description html="False">
      This road runs approximately 83 miles in a straight line.  The cache is NOT at the posted coordinates, and you should not attempt to look for anything there as you will be smack dab in the middle of 'O' street.  The cache IS however located within an area two miles east or west of the posted coordinates, and.. hmm.. lets say the distance of a decent size par 4 golf hole (400 yards or so) north or south of 'O' street.  You will need to find the other two related caches: World's Longest Straight Road - East, and World's Longest Straight Road - West, and get the partial coordinates from both to find the bonus.  Or perhaps not... there may be some of you that can sniff out the bonus with the numbers from just one of the two caches.  I'm hoping I've made it difficult enough to avoid that, but cudos to anyone that is able!

Best to park just to the north or east of the actual cache location. There may be alot of activity in the area at times, so use your best judgement and be stealthy!

        Our home base is Ottawa, Ontario. We're doing a road trip starting and ending in St. Louis that will hit 8 states (some only briefly), pausing along the way to view the total solar eclipse in Alliance, Nebraska (which we did - it was great!). We're targeting challenge caches, virtuals and other oldies, and various others of interest, mostly non-traditionals.

We had the full day to spend in the Lincoln area today, and after hitting the OCCT in the morning, we had the afternoon free.  Being partial to wherigos (we own several back home), this series really attracted our interest.  We contacted the CO before arriving in the area, to see if he would like us to replace any that are missing, but that turned out to be unnecessary.  We never expected to do them all, but they went quite smoothly, and by the end of a long afternoon, we had run the table from A to Z... not necessarily in alphabetical order, but that's the way we'll log them.  Most were quick and easy finds, though a few of the higher-terrain ones were a bit challenging.  Thanks for all the WIG fun!

        Found this cache during epic trip out west with NikCap and Geo-Nat. We had several main goals set for the week - see total solar eclipse, find the oldest caches in NE and KS and find 150+ non traditional caches. We succeeded on all the accounts! That was definitely a week we will remember for the long time. Great times and lots of amazing (and some not so amazing) cache. Thanks for bringing us to this location and thanks for the cache!

        On our quest to gather up even more non-traditional caches on our Nebraska/Kansas eclipse geocaching adventure, Jo.Cap and I headed out for the series of Wherigos.  The quizzes were fun to play and Geo-Nat provided us with the answers. Since the final were out of sequence, it is hard to recall if this one gave use trouble or not, but for the most part the coordinates were dead on.
Thanks for the series!

        On the way to GeoWoodstock with pquad &amp; Hearty Soles. Spotted this one before leaving home since it would complete my 4th fizzy challenge... Oooh! With my hardware/software the pieces were so tiny- ouch. As I worked though puzzle 1, I was very happy pquad took up the challenge on puzzle 2. We were elated when both were complete but then what about those coords? We'd both done this sort of puzzle successfully before but for some reason really struggled with these. Many thanks to the CO for the assist. Then after many hours of driving, there it was, the most lovely light pole. Thank you!

        Our home base is Ottawa, Ontario. We're doing a road trip starting and ending in St. Louis that will hit 8 states (some only briefly), pausing along the way to view the total solar eclipse in Alliance, Nebraska (which we did - it was great!). We're targeting challenge caches, virtuals and other oldies, and various others of interest, mostly non-traditionals.

We had the full day to spend in the Lincoln area today, and after hitting the OCCT in the morning, we had the afternoon free.  Being partial to wherigos (we own several back home), this series really attracted our interest.  We contacted the CO before arriving in the area, to see if he would like us to replace any that are missing, but that turned out to be unnecessary.  We never expected to do them all, but they went quite smoothly, and by the end of a long afternoon, we had run the table from A to Z... not necessarily in alphabetical order, but that's the way we'll log them.  Most were quick and easy finds, though a few of the higher-terrain ones were a bit challenging.  Thanks for all the WIG fun!

        Found this cache during epic trip out west with NikCap and Geo-Nat. We had several main goals set for the week - see total solar eclipse, find the oldest caches in NE and KS and find 150+ non traditional caches. We succeeded on all the accounts! That was definitely a week we will remember for the long time. Great times and lots of amazing (and some not so amazing) cache. Thanks for bringing us to this location and thanks for the cache!

      &lt;p&gt;This is a 4 stage multi cache that will highlight a few of the crispy critters located in the wetlands. This is far from a park and grab, so don't plan on attempting this unless you have some time to kill and really enjoy hiking! The terrain will vary depending on the weather, but no matter what time of year it is please watch your step.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;The wetlands area is open from sunrise until 1 hour after sunset. Please observe these rules, as it would be a bad idea to attempt this cache in the dark anyway! You will not need any special tools of the trade other than a pen to complete this multi, although I would reccomend a pair of tweezers for extraction purposes. The containers will not be hard to find or get to, but be warned, you will earn this smiley and the stars that go along with it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While placing this cache I saw at least 2 dozen deer. This is a great place to see wildlife so just take your time and enjoy the scenery. Have fun!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;PK4PRN9 - Parking&lt;br /&gt;N 40° 53.123 W 096° 40.670&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

        Well...  Here I am again. On an excursion with the Sunday Caching Bunch. (SCB)  Today I was suppose to be driving back to my home base, Butte, NE.  Instead, I decided that a wet, dreary, long walk with some good friends was a a better idea.  I was not wrong.  After a few time meeting corrections, we all finally arrive at the beginning of a beautiful area.  10 seconds into the walk and even I was wondering if I brought extra soxes.  
We get to S1 and instantly I'm glad we were doing this cache.  J&amp;LA was giving me a silly look, when I told her she need to see this, and get your camera read.  She was not disappointed.   I could not wait to see what was at the other stages.  Again,  not disappointed.  
As far as the old man looking at us as criminal trespassers?  We checked...  We were on NRD land.  He must not have liked us that close to his back yard fence.  I told him we'll be on our way and out of here soon.  As far as soon was concerned,  that was a fib.
We get to the last stage and one of the group was reluctant to venture to the area of the last Stage.  I said I would help them and as I was approaching them, the others could hear me saying.  "Get your butt down there right now or..."  Maybe there is a reason my children don't call much.  NAAAHHHH...  We all made it to GZ and got our much deserved group photo and smilies.  
FP given for creativity of stages and caching with Awesome People.

        This cache has been on my radar for a long long time.  Had many attempts where groups passed me by.  I found some folks who hadn't found it and we were on a mission.  As we set out like professional Cachers do on a misty gloomy, wet, muddy day we have umbrellas, boots, jean covers (gators) extra socks, water bottles, tweesers,  and smart phones.  But that could not prepare us for grumpy old man coffee in hand while we are humbly minding our business announces we were on private property..... someone **majorhusker** may or may not have fallen in mud.  Apparently after S2 we had crossed over to private property.  Oh snap now we are outlaws.  Do we run.  Nope draw our guns ready for a dual (hands up don't shoot) he surrendered stating that we were on private property as far as the eye could see.  Well we did pass over one fence but there were no signs and he wasn't ready to let us come trudge through his yard to escape our trespassing​.....Onward we go....the boys drool as they trudge thru the mud while the girls rule shouting out it's there...Finally we think we are back on NRD land soaking wet we continue marching through the prairie grass that will soon be over our heads just to get stocked by a goose.  She yelled at us for a while.  Between the helicopter circling, barking dogs, potential stray bullets, stocking goose​ and old grumpy guy we were able to finally  put our names on the log.  OMG....Don't ever do that to me again!

        We couldn't have picked a much wetter day to go hiking through a wetland.  We almost chickened out &amp; took a shortcut, but we decided not to.  Along the way we saw mallards, heard frogs, listened to birds, squished along in wet socks, got caught on barbed wire on the trail, moved said wire, missed a traditional, hopped over watery mudholes, got buzzed by geese overhead, stopped to admire thorn trees, plotted around swamps, walked through other swamps, scared 20 deer, crossed small streams, accidentally found our way on private property (really?), got barked at by dogs, got barked at by a human, showed our contempt for nature, watched for ticks, got sprinkled on, lilypadded across rocks, slid on muddy inclines, posed for a trail camera, stomped through deep muddy areas, skirted high cliffs, got stalked by 2 cussing guard geese (maybe the same one), took selfies &amp; group-ies,  wondered about nearby gunshots (eek!), repaired a stage &amp; admired the crispy critters.  All in all a fun time &amp; worth the trip, though we're all glad we left a vehicle at the end to take all of us back to the beginning. Fave point. SL TFTC #2110

        Episode 3 of "Geocaching with Itzzie ". 

To set the back story:
A couple of weeks ago, Itzzie had asked if anyone wanted to go caching with her. Well, that afternoon Sammalamma and I, along with Thundrstrk started a journey of caching with Itzzie, soon to be joined by J&amp;LA, and Jimmy63, at Airpark......afterwards, we agreed to meet up the next week at 9 mile prairie. We cleared that out, and now we're here, together again, minus Thundrstrk, to catch some Crispy Critters. 

So, we met up at a parking spot,  and started our trek. The day was overcast, and with the recent rain, some of the area was a little wet. We barely got started, when Itzzie and Sammalamma were already hinting at having wet feet. Oh well. We marched on and found our first Crispy. Sweet! He told us to move on....so we did.

Jimmy63 and I marched forth, watching the terrain, with J&amp;LA, Itzzie and Sammalamma watching us. One took the high road, the other, obviously, the low road. Eyes peeled, we saw some of Mother Nature's critters  crossing our path, or were we crossing theirs? Jimmy63 spotted our next resident. I knocked at the door, and was given the message to again, march forward. The tenant was very friendly and helpful. I passed the message along to the J&amp;LA, who then gave it to Sammalamma and Itzzie. 

Onward. We literally trudged forward, at least Jimmy63 and I did, and we really got into our work. The girls were perched, keeping an eye out, and squawking with the geese. As we located our next messenger, we had a chat with him and had to give him some emergency health care, as we had no way of communication. We contacted the vet, and got the issue resolved. After he recovered, he thanked us, and told of a place we could find peace. 

We continued on. Nature is wonderful, even without Mr. Sun shining his light. Our traveling group of friends quickly found our pot of gold. We stuck around long enough to converse with our hostess, sign her registration book, and also managed to get in a few selfie shots, but were told not to publish them, for fear of being found too early. 

We all had a lot of fun today. Sammalamma conquered some fears, and I am so proud of that. Each of us played a part in this wonderful, favorited, day. Tftc!

As for Episode 4....who knows? Itzzie knows.

The cache was a quick find at the solved coordinates.  I appreciate that the ditches in this part of Nebraska are very shallow.  Now, off to find a few more of these alphabet Wherigo caches.

        Stopped by on my way back to Colorado to pick up more of the wherigos, letterboxes, and challenge caches in the area.  I decided to solve all of the wherigos for the final coordinates and enter those into another GPS since the cartridge doesn't save the final coords.   Found most of the containers, but the wind and cold didn't help the search.  I will return another time to finish the series.

Thanks for all of the work to put out this series!

        Our home base is Ottawa, Ontario. We're doing a road trip starting and ending in St. Louis that will hit 8 states (some only briefly), pausing along the way to view the total solar eclipse in Alliance, Nebraska (which we did - it was great!). We're targeting challenge caches, virtuals and other oldies, and various others of interest, mostly non-traditionals.

We had the full day to spend in the Lincoln area today, and after hitting the OCCT in the morning, we had the afternoon free.  Being partial to wherigos (we own several back home), this series really attracted our interest.  We contacted the CO before arriving in the area, to see if he would like us to replace any that are missing, but that turned out to be unnecessary.  We never expected to do them all, but they went quite smoothly, and by the end of a long afternoon, we had run the table from A to Z... not necessarily in alphabetical order, but that's the way we'll log them.  Most were quick and easy finds, though a few of the higher-terrain ones were a bit challenging.  Thanks for all the WIG fun!

     </groundspeak:short_description>
     <groundspeak:long_description html="True">
      &lt;p&gt;The story of Loco Sanchez starts on a farm outside the small
town of Cordovilla in the province of Salamanca in the country of
Spain sometime between 1654 and 1666. He was born to a poor farming
family. In 1695 he became first mate on a Spanish privateer
assigned to attack French smugglers along the coast. The crew
became increasingly agitated after many months of no pay, and
Sanchez led a successful mutiny against the captain of the ship. He
was promptly elected captain of the newly christened Diablo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under new name, and new leadership they sailed north and quickly
captured two French and three English ships adding to his crew.
Sanchez, or Loco Sanchez as he was already beginning to be known,
would lure locals out of their villages under the pretense of trade
only to attack and capture them as slaves. Soon the name Loco
Sanchez was feared all up and down the western coasts of Europe and
Africa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In early 1697 while in the Red Sea, Loco Sanchez formed a pirate
flotilla of four ships commanded by Peg Legged Peggy, Greybeard,
and Bloody Fargloom. With these he attacked the Grand Mogul's Fatah
Mohammed and the larger 40-gun Gang-i-Seawal, which were busy
accompanying a pilgrim fleet. The Gang-i-Seawal lost its mainmast,
and a cannon exploded on deck, shortening the fight and resistance.
The passengers and crew were brutalized in hope that the locations
of any secret stash would be revealed; some jumped ship, and some
of the women committed suicide. The search yielded 650,000 Pounds
in gold, silver, and jewels in one of the largest hauls ever, and
each man got over 1500 Pounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon after the flotilla split up, and some of Loco Sanchez's
crew left to go their separate ways. Sanchez sailed west to the
Caribbean and bought the protection of the local settlements, and
proceeded to throw amazing and lavish parties for the remaining
members of his crew and the locals alike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wasn't long before representatives of the governments he had
stolen from and their fleets tracked him down. Before he could be
captured he voluntarily met with the leader of the men hunting him,
Gary Taft, and offered him 25,000 Pounds to buy his pardon. Taft
refused the deal, and Loco Sanchez and a few of his men fled on the
Diablo easily outrunning the larger fleet ships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing that their pursuers would never give up, the last
members of Sanchez's crew drove the Diablo ashore and went their
separate ways. Some stayed in the Caribbean, some went to America,
and some others returned to Spain and Europe. They were all rich
beyond their wildest dreams and had grown accustomed to their
lavish lifestyle by then and couldn't help but stick out wherever
they went. Laying lowing and pretending to be inconspicuous were
not their strong suits and thus they were easily caught.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last of Loco Sanchez's crew to finally be caught was Sanchez
himself many many years later when he returned to his home in
Cordovilla, Spain. By this time he was well over 60 years old.
Rather than the customary instantaneous execution that was
traditional for pirates of his notoriety his captors' sense of
vengeance had dulled over the years that he had eluded them, but
their greed had grown. They understood that he had evaded capture
for so long because he had not spent much of his, the largest,
share of the loot. Meaning that most of this treasure was still
somewhere in the world waiting to be found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only possession of note that Loco Sanchez had on him at the
time of his capture was a curious, hand-drawn map. He was quickly
stripped of the map, and thrown in a prison cell while his captors
made plans to spend the money that they knew they would get once
they followed the map to find Loco Sanchez's treasure. They spent
years trying to decipher the strange symbols and scribbles on the
map only to give up in frustration. Loco Sanchez was still alive
and still in prison and would never reveal a single clue as to how
to use the map even while being tortured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only response he would give was if someone asked if the map
lead to his treasure: His wrinkled, cracked lips would pull
themselves taut against his emaciated jaw bones in a hideous grin
of defiance, and he would laugh a cruel, piercing, and demented
laugh. Whatever secrets of how to use the map died along with Loco
Sanchez himself in prison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years the map has passed from father to son, from
friend to friend, but none were able to decipher where the treasure
was hidden. Reports of strange events happening to whomever
possesses the map lead to the fear that the map was cursed. People
have literally driven themselves insane pursuing the fool's errand
of trying to find the elusive treasure of Loco Sanchez.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, it is now I who have come, through rather
strange circumstances I must admit, to possess the map. While
researching the history of the map I noted some reoccurring themes:
The people who have been driven the most insane, and thereby losing
the most, from the map's curse seem to be the people who have been
the most greedy in their pursuit. Money has never been the largest
motivating factor in my life, and I'd like to imagine that I am
driven by a more scholarly pursuit than a monetary one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For these reasons, among others, I have chosen to go about
finding the treasure of Loco Sanchez via a much different path than
it has historically been sought. I, through this internet format,
intend anyone who has the motivation to solve the cursed map free
reign to go to the location revealed and claim a small portion of
the treasure for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may seem completely superstitious and the exact antithesis of
my scientific upbringing, but I have come to believe that terrible
things occur to anyone who goes about this task in a greedy manner.
I beg of you to keep fixed firmly in your mind the notion that you
will not take the entire treasure for yourself. You will only take
a few baubles or trinkets from the treasure. You are also
encouraged to work together as a team to figure out the location of
the treasure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only thing I ask in return is to keep in close
correspondence with me regarding your progress, or lack of
progress, by periodically sending me status updates through this
website. By collating and organizing the information you all send
me I will be able to fairly and equitably post any new information
that we as a community can glean from this map. This way everyone
will have an equal and fair chance of receiving their hard earned
share of the treasure. You can all be assured that I will not take
the knowledge you send me to find and take all of the treasure for
myself, because I believe if that was my intention the map would
claim me as it's next victim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, the document is very very old and very very fragile
so I won't be allowing any of the treasure seekers to handle the
map itself directly, but I have had a team of restoration experts
enhance it as much as possible removing as many layers of filth as
they could while keeping the detail intact. I then created several
high quality scan of the map so I could post them on this website.
First, is a smaller compressed jpeg image so you can get an idea of
what we're dealing with, but I also encourage you to take a look at
the high resolution image in the link below. The dimensions of the
original map are roughly eight and a half inches by eight and a
half inches square.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, without any further ado I present to you, fellow scholars,
the fabled (and most likely cursed) treasure map of Loco
Sanchez:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

      The &lt;b&gt;Playfair cipher&lt;/b&gt; is a manual symemetric encryption technique and was the first literal digraph substitution cipher. The scheme was invented in 1854 by Charles Wheatstone, but bears the name of Lord Playfair who promoted the use of the cipher.
&lt;p&gt;The technique encrypts pairs of letters (&lt;i&gt;digraphs&lt;/i&gt;), instead of single letters as in the simple substitution cipher and rather more complex Vigenere cipher systems then in use. The Playfair is thus significantly harder to break since the frequency analysis used for simple substitution ciphers does not work with it. Frequency analysis can still be undertaken, but on the 600 possible digraphs rather than the 26 possible monographs. The frequency analysis of digraphs is possible, but considerably more difficult – and it generally requires a much larger ciphertext in order to be useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is a series of caches all being letterboxes, none of the hides are tough, just look in the obvious locations. Some of the micro sized containers, do not contain an ink pad, so please bring your own if you choose to stamp. Do not take the stamp or ink pad, they must stay in the container.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;

        Stopped by on my way back to Colorado to pick up more of the wherigos, letterboxes, and challenge caches in the area.  I decided to solve all of the wherigos for the final coordinates and enter those into another GPS since the cartridge doesn't save the final coords.   Found most of the containers, but the wind and cold didn't help the search.  I will return another time to finish the series.

Thanks for all of the work to put out this series!

        Our home base is Ottawa, Ontario. We're doing a road trip starting and ending in St. Louis that will hit 8 states (some only briefly), pausing along the way to view the total solar eclipse in Alliance, Nebraska (which we did - it was great!). We're targeting challenge caches, virtuals and other oldies, and various others of interest, mostly non-traditionals.

We had the full day to spend in the Lincoln area today, and after hitting the OCCT in the morning, we had the afternoon free.  Being partial to wherigos (we own several back home), this series really attracted our interest.  We contacted the CO before arriving in the area, to see if he would like us to replace any that are missing, but that turned out to be unnecessary.  We never expected to do them all, but they went quite smoothly, and by the end of a long afternoon, we had run the table from A to Z... not necessarily in alphabetical order, but that's the way we'll log them.  Most were quick and easy finds, though a few of the higher-terrain ones were a bit challenging.  Thanks for all the WIG fun!

        Found this cache during epic trip out west with NikCap and Geo-Nat. We had several main goals set for the week - see total solar eclipse, find the oldest caches in NE and KS and find 150+ non traditional caches. We succeeded on all the accounts! That was definitely a week we will remember for the long time. Great times and lots of amazing (and some not so amazing) cache. Thanks for bringing us to this location and thanks for the cache!

        This was the last cartridge that I had time to run today.  I had the "Z" answers in no time.

I put the final coordinates into my device incorrectly the first time.  I was at a logical location, but I could not find the container.  Fortunately, I had a copy of the coordinates and was able to get the correct coordinates without re-running the cartridge.

I needed a lot of time to find the cache at the correct final.  The only reason that I stayed was that the geotrail seemed to right.  Finally, I saw the container.  It blended into its surroundings well.

Thanks for the cache.

      Neon Trees is an American alternative rock band from Provo, Utah, with origins in Murrieta, California. The band received nationwide exposure in late 2008 when they opened several North American tour dates for the band The Killers. Not long after, the band was signed by Mercury Records and released their first full length album, Habits, in 2010. Their first single "Animal" climbed to No. 13 on the Billboard Hot 100 and No. 1 on the Alternative rock Chart.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Band Members&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
    Tyler Glenn – lead vocals, piano, synthesizer (2005–present)&lt;br /&gt;
    Christopher Allen – guitar, vocals (2005–present)&lt;br /&gt;
    Branden Campbell – bass, vocals (2006–present)&lt;br /&gt;
    Elaine Bradley – drums, percussion, vocals (2006–present)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Now that you have learned about the neon trees, solve this puzzle that has nothing to do with the band!&lt;br /&gt;

        Our home base is Ottawa, Ontario. We're doing a road trip starting and ending in St. Louis that will hit 8 states (some only briefly), pausing along the way to view the total solar eclipse in Alliance, Nebraska (which we did - it was great!). We're targeting challenge caches, virtuals and other oldies, and various others of interest, mostly non-traditionals.

We had the full day to spend in the Lincoln area today, and after hitting the OCCT in the morning, we had the afternoon free.  Being partial to wherigos (we own several back home), this series really attracted our interest.  We contacted the CO before arriving in the area, to see if he would like us to replace any that are missing, but that turned out to be unnecessary.  We never expected to do them all, but they went quite smoothly, and by the end of a long afternoon, we had run the table from A to Z... not necessarily in alphabetical order, but that's the way we'll log them.  Most were quick and easy finds, though a few of the higher-terrain ones were a bit challenging.  Thanks for all the WIG fun!

        Found this cache during epic trip out west with NikCap and Geo-Nat. We had several main goals set for the week - see total solar eclipse, find the oldest caches in NE and KS and find 150+ non traditional caches. We succeeded on all the accounts! That was definitely a week we will remember for the long time. Great times and lots of amazing (and some not so amazing) cache. Thanks for bringing us to this location and thanks for the cache!

        On our quest to gather up even more non-traditional caches on our Nebraska/Kansas eclipse geocaching adventure, Jo.Cap and I headed out for the series of Wherigos.  The quizzes were fun to play and Geo-Nat provided us with the answers. Since the final were out of sequence, it is hard to recall if this one gave use trouble or not, but for the most part the coordinates were dead on.
Thanks for the series!

        This was another fast cartridge to run.  I had the coordinates in no time.  Then, it was a matter of figuring out the order in which to go to the final in the most efficient way.

At the final, I think I got lucky to find this container.  I just happened to look at the right place first.  Thanks for the cache.

        Our home base is Ottawa, Ontario. We're doing a road trip starting and ending in St. Louis that will hit 8 states (some only briefly), pausing along the way to view the total solar eclipse in Alliance, Nebraska (which we did - it was great!). We're targeting challenge caches, virtuals and other oldies, and various others of interest, mostly non-traditionals.

We had the full day to spend in the Lincoln area today, and after hitting the OCCT in the morning, we had the afternoon free.  Being partial to wherigos (we own several back home), this series really attracted our interest.  We contacted the CO before arriving in the area, to see if he would like us to replace any that are missing, but that turned out to be unnecessary.  We never expected to do them all, but they went quite smoothly, and by the end of a long afternoon, we had run the table from A to Z... not necessarily in alphabetical order, but that's the way we'll log them.  Most were quick and easy finds, though a few of the higher-terrain ones were a bit challenging.  Thanks for all the WIG fun!

        Found this cache during epic trip out west with NikCap and Geo-Nat. We had several main goals set for the week - see total solar eclipse, find the oldest caches in NE and KS and find 150+ non traditional caches. We succeeded on all the accounts! That was definitely a week we will remember for the long time. Great times and lots of amazing (and some not so amazing) cache. Thanks for bringing us to this location and thanks for the cache!

We never expected to do them all, but they went quite smoothly, and by the end of a long afternoon, we had run the table from A to Z... not necessarily in alphabetical order, but that's the way we'll log them.  Most were quick and easy finds, though a few of the higher-terrain ones were a bit challenging.  Thanks for all the WIG fun!

        At this location, when I arrived to play the cartridge, I found that if I went past the location the avoid blocking a driveway, I moved out of the zone and the cartridge would not run. I had to back up to return to the zone. I played it as quick as I could to get out of the way in case anyone needed to go in or out.

At the final location, I had trouble finding the container. At the coordinates, I found the remains of a tree. I had to expand the search area to make the find. I finally found the container about 60 feet south of the solved location. A couple people passed while I was searching.  I hope that I did not cause any concern with being parked along the road for the time that it took me to search for the cache.

        Found this cache during epic trip out west with NikCap and Geo-Nat. We had several main goals set for the week - see total solar eclipse, find the oldest caches in NE and KS and find 150+ non traditional caches. We succeeded on all the accounts! That was definitely a week we will remember for the long time. Great times and lots of amazing (and some not so amazing) cache. Thanks for bringing us to this location and thanks for the cache!

        On our quest to gather up even more non-traditional caches on our Nebraska/Kansas eclipse geocaching adventure, Jo.Cap and I headed out for the series of Wherigos.  The quizzes were fun to play and Geo-Nat provided us with the answers. Since the final were out of sequence, it is hard to recall if this one gave use trouble or not, but for the most part the coordinates were dead on.
Thanks for the series!

        Our home base is Ottawa, Ontario. We're doing a road trip starting and ending in St. Louis that will hit 8 states (some only briefly), pausing along the way to view the total solar eclipse in Alliance, Nebraska (which we did - it was great!). We're targeting challenge caches, virtuals and other oldies, and various others of interest, mostly non-traditionals.

We had the full day to spend in the Lincoln area today, and after hitting the OCCT in the morning, we had the afternoon free.  Being partial to wherigos (we own several back home), this series really attracted our interest.  We contacted the CO before arriving in the area, to see if he would like us to replace any that are missing, but that turned out to be unnecessary.  We never expected to do them all, but they went quite smoothly, and by the end of a long afternoon, we had run the table from A to Z... not necessarily in alphabetical order, but that's the way we'll log them.  Most were quick and easy finds, though a few of the higher-terrain ones were a bit challenging.  Thanks for all the WIG fun!

We had several main goals set for the week - see total solar eclipse, find the oldest caches in NE and KS and find 150+ non traditional caches. We succeeded on all the accounts!

        On our quest to gather up even more non-traditional caches on our Nebraska/Kansas eclipse geocaching adventure, Jo.Cap and I headed out for the series of Wherigos.  The quizzes were fun to play and Geo-Nat provided us with the answers. Since the final were out of sequence, it is hard to recall if this one gave use trouble or not, but for the most part the coordinates were dead on.
Thanks for the series!

        Visiting from Colorado. This is my second time here to get the many wherigos, challenges, and letterboxes in this area.

Since the cartridge doesn't save the coordinates of the final, I solved all of them while saving the final coords into another GPS.  I didn't find all of the containers, but the cold and wind didn't help.  I'm sure I'll be able to find the rest of the series next time I'm here.

      Welcome to my A - Z wherigo series. These will be quick and simple wherigo's. You will be required to take a small 3 question test to get to the final location. My son helped me on these so I think everyone should be able to get the answers.

        As others mentioned the coords take you to a field with nothing that would be a tell tale cache hide. Either the coords are 50 feet off or someone added a replacement across the street. Tftc!

        Our home base is Ottawa, Ontario. We're doing a road trip starting and ending in St. Louis that will hit 8 states (some only briefly), pausing along the way to view the total solar eclipse in Alliance, Nebraska (which we did - it was great!). We're targeting challenge caches, virtuals and other oldies, and various others of interest, mostly non-traditionals.

We had the full day to spend in the Lincoln area today, and after hitting the OCCT in the morning, we had the afternoon free.  Being partial to wherigos (we own several back home), this series really attracted our interest.  We contacted the CO before arriving in the area, to see if he would like us to replace any that are missing, but that turned out to be unnecessary.  We never expected to do them all, but they went quite smoothly, and by the end of a long afternoon, we had run the table from A to Z... not necessarily in alphabetical order, but that's the way we'll log them.  Most were quick and easy finds, though a few of the higher-terrain ones were a bit challenging.  Thanks for all the WIG fun!

        Found this cache during epic trip out west with NikCap and Geo-Nat. We had several main goals set for the week - see total solar eclipse, find the oldest caches in NE and KS and find 150+ non traditional caches. We succeeded on all the accounts! That was definitely a week we will remember for the long time. Great times and lots of amazing (and some not so amazing) cache. Thanks for bringing us to this location and thanks for the cache!

We decided to try our luck with one, and this is the result. Hope you enjoy it!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#993300"&gt;Havelock is a small town within a city in the Northeast part of Lincoln. It has its own business district, parks, and personality. This picto-cache will take you on a quick walking tour through the area. If you have time, there are some great places to eat --- including Misty's (nationally known for their prime rib), the Isles (a pub with great pizza), the Engine House (a restaurant housed in an old fire station) to name a few.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#993300"&gt;The starting coordinates will take you to the recommended parking area to get you started. From that point, you will use the pictures below to direct you to the cache. Please keep in mind that you may have to step a couple of feet this way or that when looking for the next clue. Some of the photos have been taken at a different angle than you may see them from your position. Most have been cropped to make them a bit more difficult to identify. Some are close up shots --- others may be taken from a couple of blocks away. But --- hopefully by following this trail of images, you'll be able to locate the cache. The cache container is a bison tube with a log, but you'll need to bring your own pen/pencil. The tour will likely take between 30-45 minutes --- depending upon how sharp your eye is and how fast you walk! Have fun!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;

        We came to this neighborhood this morning for breakfast and noticed this photo tour. So we took the extra stroll after eating and enjoyed the tour greatly. So many interesting details packed into a small neighborhood! Thanks for the tour and the smiley.
BTW We have a "little pictures" cache of our own (GC36RTM) like this in our home town in California. Ours is more work though -- about 60-80 minutes by our estimate.

        I went caching with Monty12 in the Lincoln area.  This was a fun puzzle and was my first time to do a cache like this.  We ended up driving the first 1/2 and walked the second 1/2.  We had trouble locating a couple of the picture clues, but persevered and were successful.  It is always fun to find an old cache.  Added to my favorite list.  TFTC.  #5101.  SL.

        Out for the day with halllilley.  This was our last cache of the day.  I had wanted to do this for a few years.  Seems like when it was enabled, I wasn't there and when I was in the area it was disabled.  We did this 1/2 by car and 1/2 by foot.  We had lots of fun looking for the needed images.  After finding the cache, we saw we had been by it several times and didn't see it.  We were so focused on finding the images.  I'm giving this a favorite point.

        Having solved a few of these Wherigoes, this was the first location that I passed where I had a solution.  It took me a few moments of wondering around before I found the container.

The Wherigo cartriage played quickly on my device.  I knew the answers.  I must have spelled the answers correctly because each answer was accepted.  Thanks for this neat trail of geocaches.

        Stopped by on my way back to Colorado to pick up more of the wherigos, letterboxes, and challenge caches in the area.  I decided to solve all of the wherigos for the final coordinates and enter those into another GPS since the cartridge doesn't save the final coords.   Found most of the containers, but the wind and cold didn't help the search.  I will return another time to finish the series.

Thanks for all of the work to put out this series!

      An offset cache is a particular type of multi-cache. The coordinates for an offset cache are the location of an existing monument, plaque, or other object. Information on that object is used to calculate the coordinates of the cache container.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is a series of caches all being letterboxes, none of the hides are tough, just look in the obvious locations. Some of the micro sized containers, do not contain an ink pad, so please bring your own if you choose to stamp. Do not take the stamp or ink pad, they must stay in the container.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;

      CACHE IS NOT AT POSTED COORDINATES 

Everyone is telling me which way to go. "Turn here." "Turn there!" "Go back, you missed your turn!!!" Sometimes I feel like I'm going in circles! Well, now I get to tell you where to go. Luckily, it is my very own private island in Lincoln. Don't worry, you shouldn't get wet. Just follow my directions, and you'll get there eventually. It may not be the most direct way though... FTF gets an unactivated Travel Bug!  

However,... 

This is a CURSED cache for all First to Finders out there. If you are the FTF for a cache in this series, you are cursed with the obligation to place another "THE CURSE OF THE FTF" cache and therefore extend the series. 

Guidelines for this series are below: 
1. FTF'er should place the next cache in the series [THE CURSE OF THE FTF #12 (Nebraska Chapter)] within 2 months, otherwise the curse will prevent you from ever getting another FTF again!!!  HA HA!! 
2. You can only be a FTF for this series once. This spreads the FTF love around, and gives others a chance to play along. 
3. Cache can be any type of cache (Puzzle, Multi, etc.). 
4. You must include this set of guidelines in your listing for the series, and include the list of all who have been cursed before you. 

Those who have been cursed so far in this series: 
bosac - started curse May 4, 2008 
j.a.g.k. (Cursed on May 9, 2008) - curse lifted May 21, 2008

      On Monday, August 21, 2017, all of North America will be treated to an eclipse of the sun.  Anyone within the path of totality can see one of nature’s most awe inspiring sights - a total solar eclipse. This path, where the moon will completely cover the sun and the sun's tenuous atmosphere - the corona - can be seen, will stretch from Salem, Oregon, through Nebraska, to Charleston, South Carolina. Observers outside this path will still see a partial solar eclipse where the moon covers part of the sun's disk.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img alt="Eclipse" src="https://img.geocaching.com/cache/large/ff82e3ea-481b-4b27-99a3-dcf86dd524ec.jpg" style="width:426px;height:191px;" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Solar Eclipse&lt;br /&gt;
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia&lt;br /&gt;
Not to be confused with Lunar eclipse.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Total solar eclipse&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A total solar eclipse occurs when the Moon completely covers the Sun's disk, as seen in this 1999 solar eclipse. Solar prominences can be seen along the limb (in red) as well as extensive coronal filaments. An annular solar eclipse (above) occurs when the Moon is too far away to completely cover the Sun's disk (May 20, 2012). During a partial solar eclipse (below), the Moon blocks only part of the Sun's disk (October 23, 2014).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A solar eclipse (as seen from the planet Earth) is a type of eclipse that occurs when the Moon passes between the Sun and Earth, and when the Moon fully or partially blocks ("occults") the Sun. This can happen only at new moon when the Sun and the Moon are in conjunction as seen from Earth in an alignment referred to as syzygy. In a total eclipse, the disk of the Sun is fully obscured by the Moon. In partial and annular eclipses, only part of the Sun is obscured.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img alt="Solar Eclipse" src="https://img.geocaching.com/cache/large/41dc78dc-e9f4-4b74-89d3-780381e481f8.jpg" style="width:295px;height:192px;" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If the Moon were in a perfectly circular orbit, a little closer to the Earth, and in the same orbital plane, there would be total solar eclipses every month. However, since the Moon's orbit is tilted at more than 5 degrees to the Earth's orbit around the Sun, its shadow usually misses Earth. The Moon's orbit must cross Earth's ecliptic plane in order for an eclipse (both solar as well as lunar) to occur. In addition, the Moon's actual orbit is elliptical, often taking it far enough away from Earth that its apparent size is not large enough to block the Sun entirely. N five:three, zero ; seventy one:nine, one hundred ninety four:one ; two hundred ninety four:one, four hundred and forty:one, zero. The orbital planes cross each other at a line of nodes resulting in at least two, and up to five, solar eclipses occurring each year; no more than two of which can be total eclipses. However, total solar eclipses are rare at any particular location because totality exists only along a narrow path on the Earth's surface traced by the Moon's shadow or umbra.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
An eclipse is a natural phenomenon. However, in some ancient and modern cultures, solar eclipses were attributed to supernatural causes or regarded as bad omens. A total solar eclipse can be frightening to people who are unaware of its astronomical explanation, as the Sun seems to disappear during the day and the sky darkens in a matter of minutes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Since looking directly at the Sun can lead to permanent eye damage or blindness, special eye protection or indirect viewing techniques are used when viewing a solar eclipse. It is technically safe to view only the total phase of a total solar eclipse with the unaided eye and without protection; however, this is a dangerous practice, as most people are not trained to recognize the phases of an eclipse, which can span over two hours while the total phase can only last a maximum of 7.5 minutes for any one location.  You may have to turn around bright eyes, www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmALEmGveCE&amp;amp;sns=em your love is like a shadow on me all of the time. People referred to as eclipse chasers or umbraphiles will travel to remote locations to observe or witness predicted central solar eclipses.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For the dates of the next eclipses see the section Recent and forthcoming solar eclipses.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Types&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are four types of solar eclipses:&lt;br /&gt;
•A total eclipse occurs when the dark silhouette of the Moon completely obscures the intensely bright light of the Sun, allowing the much fainter solar corona to be visible. During any one eclipse, totality occurs at best only in a narrow track on the surface of Earth.&lt;br /&gt;
•An annular eclipse occurs when the Sun and Moon are exactly in line with the Earth, but the apparent size of the Moon is smaller than that of the Sun. Hence the Sun appears as a very bright ring, or annulus, surrounding the dark disk of the Moon.&lt;br /&gt;
•A hybrid eclipse (also called annular/total eclipse) shifts between a total and annular eclipse. At certain points on the surface of Earth, it appears as a total eclipse, whereas at other points it appears as annular. Hybrid eclipses are comparatively rare.&lt;br /&gt;
•A partial eclipse occurs when the Sun and Moon are not exactly in line with the Earth and the Moon only partially obscures the Sun. This phenomenon can usually be seen from a large part of the Earth outside of the track of an annular or total eclipse. However, some eclipses can only be seen as a partial eclipse, because the umbra passes above the Earth's polar regions and never intersects the Earth's surface. Partial eclipses are virtually unnoticeable in terms of the sun's brightness, as it takes well over 90% coverage to notice any darkening at all. Even at 99%, it would be no darker than civil twilight. Of course, partial eclipses (and partial stages of other eclipses) can be observed if one is viewing the sun through a darkening filter (which should anyhow be used for safety).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Sun's distance from Earth is about 400 times the Moon's distance, and the Sun's diameter is about 400 times the Moon's diameter. Because these ratios are approximately the same, the Sun and the Moon as seen from Earth appear to be approximately the same size: about 0.5 degree of arc in angular measure.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A separate category of solar eclipses is that of the Sun being occluded by a body other than the Earth's moon, as can be observed at points in space away from the Earth's surface. Two examples are when the crew of Apollo 12 observed the Earth eclipse the Sun in 1969 and when the Cassini probe observed Saturn eclipsing the Sun in 2006.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img alt="Stages" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/gs-geo-images/ba99b5bd-2be1-44b2-b17e-4c28a1f86e72_l.jpg" style="width:640px;height:233px;" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Moon's orbit around the Earth is an ellipse, as is the Earth's orbit around the Sun. The apparent sizes of the Sun and Moon therefore vary. The magnitude of an eclipse is the ratio of the apparent size of the Moon to the apparent size of the Sun during an eclipse. An eclipse that occurs when the Moon is near its closest distance to Earth (i.e., near its perigee) can be a total eclipse because the Moon will appear to be large enough to completely cover the Sun's bright disk or photosphere; a total eclipse has a magnitude greater than conversely, an eclipse that occurs when the Moon is near its farthest distance from Earth (i.e., near its apogee) can only be an annular eclipse because the Moon will appear to be slightly smaller than the Sun; the magnitude of an annular eclipse is less than slightly more solar eclipses are annular than total because, on average, the Moon lies too far from Earth to cover the Sun completely.  A hybrid eclipse occurs when the magnitude of an eclipse changes during the event from less to greater than one, so the eclipse appears to be total at some locations on Earth and annular at other locations.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Because the Earth's orbit around the Sun is also elliptical, the Earth's distance from the Sun similarly varies throughout the year. This affects the apparent size of the Sun in the same way, but not as much as does the Moon's varying distance from Earth. When Earth approaches its farthest distance from the Sun in July, a total eclipse is somewhat more likely, whereas conditions favour an annular eclipse when Earth approaches its closest distance to the Sun in January.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Terminology for central eclipse&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Each icon shows the view from the centre of its black spot, representing the moon (not to scale)&lt;br /&gt;
Central eclipse is often used as a generic term for a total, annular, or hybrid eclipse. This is, however, not completely correct: the definition of a central eclipse is an eclipse during which the central line of the umbra touches the Earth's surface. It is possible, though extremely rare, that part of the umbra intersects with the Earth (thus creating an annular or total eclipse), but not its central line. This is then called a non-central total or annular eclipse. The last non-central solar eclipse was on April 29, 2014. This was an annular eclipse. The next non-central total solar eclipse will be on April 9, 2043.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The phases observed during a total eclipse are called:&lt;br /&gt;
•First contact—when the Moon's limb (edge) is exactly tangential to the Sun's limb.&lt;br /&gt;
•Second contact—starting with Baily's Beads (caused by light shining through valleys on the Moon's surface) and the diamond ring effect. Almost the entire disk is covered.&lt;br /&gt;
•Totality—the Moon obscures the entire disk of the Sun and only the solar corona is visible.&lt;br /&gt;
•Third contact—when the first bright light becomes visible and the Moon's shadow is moving away from the observer. Again a diamond ring may be observed.&lt;br /&gt;
•Fourth contact—when the trailing edge of the Moon ceases to overlap with the solar disk and the eclipse ends.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Path&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
During a central eclipse, the Moon's umbra (or antumbra, in the case of an annular eclipse) moves rapidly from west to east across the Earth. The Earth is also rotating from west to east, at about 28 km/min at the Equator, but as the Moon is moving in the same direction as the Earth's spin at about 61 km/min, you will need to use the video to solve the puzzle and the umbra almost always appears to move in a roughly west-east direction across a map of the Earth at the speed of the Moon's orbital velocity minus the Earth's rotational velocity.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The width of the track of a central eclipse varies according to the relative apparent diameters of the Sun and Moon. In the most favourable circumstances, when a total eclipse occurs very close to perigee, the track can be up to 267 km (166 mi) wide and the duration of totality may be over 7 minutes. Outside of the central track, a partial eclipse is seen over a much larger area of the Earth. Typically, the umbra is 100–160 km wide, while the penumbral diameter is in excess of 6400 km.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img alt="Path" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/gs-geo-images/7d9a062a-f8e9-422b-8d59-fd624572f7e4_l.jpg" style="width:640px;height:525px;" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Duration&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The following factors determine the duration of a total solar eclipse (in order of decreasing importance):&lt;br /&gt;
1.The moon being almost exactly at perigee (making its angular diameter as large as possible).&lt;br /&gt;
2.The earth being very near aphelion (furthest away from the sun in its elliptical orbit, making its angular diameter nearly as small as possible).&lt;br /&gt;
3.The midpoint of the eclipse being very close to the earth's equator, where the orbital velocity is greatest.&lt;br /&gt;
4.The vector of the eclipse path at the midpoint of the eclipse aligning with the vector of the earth's rotation (i.e. not diagonal but due east).&lt;br /&gt;
5.The midpoint of the eclipse being near the subsolar point (the part of the earth closest to the sun).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The longest eclipse that has been calculated thus far is the eclipse of July 16, 2186 (with a maximum duration of 7 minutes 4 seconds over northern Guyana).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Eclipse path for total and hybrid eclipses from 2001 to 2020.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Eclipses only occur in the eclipse season, when the Sun is close to either the ascending or descending node of the Moon. Each eclipse is separated by one, five or six lunations (synodic months), and the midpoint of each season is separated by 173.3 days, which is the mean time for the Sun to travel from one node to the next. The period is a little less than half a calendar year because the lunar nodes slowly regress. Because 223 synodic months is roughly equal to 239 anomalistic months and 242 draconic months, eclipses with similar geometry recur 223 synodic months (about 6,585.3 days) apart. This period (18 years 11.3 days) is a saros. Because 223 synodic months is not identical to 239 anomalistic months or 242 draconic months, saros cycles do not endlessly repeat. The opposite of east is zero, 95, three three six ; 523, one two two six ; 1416, one nine nine eight, 2360.   Each begins with the Moon's shadow crossing the earth near the north or south pole, and subsequent events progress toward the other pole until the Moon's shadow misses the earth and the series ends. Saros cycles are numbered; currently, cycles 117 to 156 are active.&lt;br /&gt;

        Finally solved this cache puzzle, now to just wait until it warms up to go spend the time to search for the container. This is an interesting cache due to the fact that so many experienced cachers have looked for it but have come up empty handed with the find. I wonder how many cachers have looked for the container but have not logged a DNF online. Who will be the FTF on this cache???

      Polybius was a Greek historian of the Hellenistic Period noted for his work, The Histories, which covered the period of 264–146 BC in detail. The work describes in part the rise of the Roman Republic and its gradual domination over Greece. Polybius is also renowned for his ideas concerning the separation of powers in government, later used in Montesquieu's The Spirit of the Laws and in the drafting of the United States Constitution.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Polybius was born in Arcadia around 200 BC. He was the son of Lycortas, a Greek politician who became Cavalry Commander of the Achaean League. His father's opposition to Roman control of Macedonia resulted in his imprisonment. Polybius was then deported to Rome, where Lucius Aemilius Paulus employed him to tutor his two sons.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Polybius had the opportunity to return to Macedonia in 152 BC; he elected to stay, however, in Rome, as by that time he had placed his allegiance in the Roman Republic. He became a close friend of the Roman military commander Scipio Aemilianus, accompanying the general to Hispania and Africa. Polybius's The Histories provides a detailed account of Rome's ascent to empire and included his eyewitness account of the Sack of Carthage in 146 BC. Polybius held that historians should only chronicle events whose participants the historian was able to interview, and was among the first to champion the notion of having factual integrity in historical writing, while avoiding bias.&lt;br /&gt;

        I did it!  I solved the puzzle!  Woohoo!  I actually signed this log a long time ago but haven't logged the find online yet.  But now that I solved it I am going to go ahead and log it!  Thanks for bringing me here (more than once to be honest)!  My kids absolutely LOVED playing around GZ!  I'm pretty sure they would've spent all day here if I let them!  And thanks again for the puzzle!  It didn't take me nearly as long as I expected it to!  :)

        Out with nemik53 to get some caches we needed to complete challenges and to find ones that were missing from previous trips. This was one you replaced. Glad it was still there.   This was the second one of the day and the mosquitoes greeted us at GZ.  Thanks for the cache.

        Another cacher mentioned that they'd found this cache but had no clue how to solve it.  Just out of giggles we took a look &amp; had the answer in about 5 min.  Felt good because many puzzles leave us scratching our heads for long periods of time.  This was one of those rare instances where we lucked out.  SL Team F&amp;A for fun &amp; adventure.

        Better late than never to get my souvenir for International Geocaching Day!  My daughter was still awake, so I took her with me to meet up with Itzzie at GZ.  PrincessEliza made the find, we all signed the log and replaced as found!  Thanks for the fun puzzle!  I've had it solved for quite a while now but tonight was the night to finally go get it I guess!  LOL!  Thanks for bringing us here!  We got to see a sweet lightning storm!  :)

      H is for Hiking -
     </groundspeak:short_description>
     <groundspeak:long_description html="True">
      &lt;b&gt;Hiking&lt;/b&gt; is an outdoor activity which consists of walking in natural environments, often in mountainous or other scenic terrain. People often hike on hiking trails. It is such a popular activity that there are numerous hiking organizations worldwide. The health benefits of different types of hiking have been confirmed in studies.Some of the health benefits of hiking include, but are not limited to, losing excess weight, decreasing hypertension, and improving mental health.The word &lt;i&gt;hiking&lt;/i&gt; is understood in all English-speaking countries, but there are differences in usage.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I never knew I enjoyed the outdoors and hiking until I started geocaching, the hobby has helped me lose over 75 pounds since I began caching. The moral to the story, GET OUT AND HIKE!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is a series of caches all being letterboxes, none of the hides are tough, just look in the obvious locations. Some of the micro sized containers, do not contain an ink pad, so please bring your own if you choose to stamp. Do not take the stamp or ink pad, they must stay in the container.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;

        I don't know when *exactly* I qualified for this one, but I do (stats are public).  I signed the log in January of 2015 with Itzzie.  I am pretty sure I got the last cache to qualify (a letterbox) in June or July of 2015 when the infamous carnigrewal was in town.  We were driving by a random cemetery that had a letterbox in it and I told the group I had never gotten one before, so they all stopped so I could sign it.  LOL!  Carni kept giving me grief that I was messing up his D/T stats by "making him get this letterbox."  Haha!  It was a fun day.  I had been meaning to log this one ever since then but couldn't remember exactly where it was.  I was randomly looking at my map this morning and saw it, so I told myself I had better log this before I forget for another year!  LOL!  Thanks for the fun challenge!  :)

      &lt;p&gt;The term &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;ground zero&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; describes the point on the Earth's surface closest to a detonation.In the case of an explosion above the ground, &lt;i&gt;ground zero&lt;/i&gt; refers to the point on the ground directly below the detonation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term has often been associated with nuclear explosions and other large bombs, but is also used in relation to earthquakes, epidemics, and other disasters to mark the point of the most severe damage or destruction. The term is often re-used for disasters that have a geographic or conceptual epicenter.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Ground Zero is also a term used in geocaching, explaining where a cache is placed, once you arrive to the listed coordinates, you are now at GROUND ZERO!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is a series of caches all being letterboxes, none of the hides are tough, just look in the obvious locations. Some of the micro sized containers, do not contain an ink pad, so please bring your own if you choose to stamp. Do not take the stamp or ink pad, they must stay in the container.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;h4&gt;Welcome to Punny Puzzle 4&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can almost hear the collective groan from our fellow geocachers. But, believe it or not, we’ve heard that some people actually like these puzzles. So, here we go again. Enjoy if you can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Puzzle&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many types of puzzle caches out there. Challenge caches, various codes and/or ciphers, Sudoku puzzles, Kakuro puzzles, number fill-ins, numerous calculations and formulas, and many more. Hopefully, at least a few of our fellow geocachers will find this puzzle a little…punny (we mean funny).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;N ab cd.efg W hij kl.mno&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listed below are 15 music related puns. All you need to do is match the punchline with the first part of the pun. Once all the puns are matched up, plug the number (from the punchline list) into the appropriate space in the coordinates (using the letters from the first part of the pun).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;For Example:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the answer to pun “B” is “they just string you along. (1)”, plug the number “1” into position “B” of the coordinates (N a1 cd.efg W hij kl.mno). By the way...this is not the correct answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is a small lock-n-lock container that should not be too difficult to find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verify your guess using the link below. Good luck and we hope you have fun solving our fourth punny puzzle cache.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;A. He often broke into song because…&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;it's ragtime. (0)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;B. When a jazz musician's clothes are all worn out…&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;to keep the piece. (0)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;C. Where should you take baroque musical instruments?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;they just string you along. (1)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;D. Did you hear about the music store that was robbed?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;re-percussions. (9)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;E. Contrary to most singers and guitarists, bass players are…&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The thief made away with the lute. (2)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;F. The consequence of repeatedly playing drums loudly is…&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;a chord of wood. (4)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;G. Musicians need a leader because…&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;he couldn't find the key. (4)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;H. Two brothers fought over some sheet music but their mother wanted…&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The repair shop. (4)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;I. The conductor who didn't pay his orchestra…&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;or they might get A Flat. (6)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;J. After working all day, musicians love to return to…&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;very low-key. (7)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;K. Chop up an old piano and you will get…&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;home suite home. (6)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;L. Never date a piano repairman…&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;so they always broke into song. (1)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;M. Musicians driving home better B Sharp…&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;but couldn’t get a Handel on it. (8)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;N. The barber shop quartet could never find the right key…&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;they don't know how to conduct themselves. (3)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;O. Tried to remember who composed “Water Music”…&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;had to face the music. (9)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

        After inking 3, it's on to 4! My 12 yr old little girl was a trooper. Only complaining a little.....or a lot, depending on the perspective. She's not the outdoorsy type. However, she survived. Until we had to pull over on the way home to get a tick out of the H3. She freaked, vowing to never go through the woods again. We'll see. Thanks for the fun pun puzzles, we'd like to see more of them. Tftc!!

      A &lt;b&gt;first aid kit&lt;/b&gt; is a collection of supplies and equipment for use in giving first aid, and can put together for the purpose (by an individual or organization, for instance), or purchased complete. There is a wide variation in the contents of first aid kits based on the knowledge and experience of those putting it together, the differing first aid requirements of the area where it may be used, and variations in legislation or regulation in a given area.&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;These are highly recommended by yours truly while caching, they come into great use!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This is a series of caches all being letterboxes, none of the hides are tough, just look in the obvious locations. Some of the micro sized containers, do not contain an ink pad, so please bring your own if you choose to stamp. Do not take the stamp or ink pad, they must stay in the container.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

        Our home base is Ottawa, Ontario. We're doing a road trip starting and ending in St. Louis that will hit 8 states (some only briefly), pausing along the way to view the total solar eclipse in Alliance, Nebraska (which we did - it was great!). We're targeting challenge caches, virtuals and other oldies, and various others of interest, mostly non-traditionals.

We had the full day to spend in the Lincoln area today, so we spent the morning doing OCCT caches, and the afternoon doing the A to Z wherigo series.  When planning this trip, we were surprised to see this puzzle cache placed by a prominent Ontario cacher, so we had to solve it.  We stopped by GZ on our way to dinner nearby (Lazlo's - great place!), and made a quick find.

Thanks Carni, for adding more fun (and a nice DT) to an already memorable day.

Seen something like this in another cache, but didn't needed to work so hard on that other cache.
FP for the unique solution.

&lt;br /&gt;
Birds (class Aves) are feathered, winged, bipedal, endothermic (warm-blooded), egg-laying, vertebrate animals. With around 10,000 living species, they are the most speciose class of tetrapod vertebrates. All present species belong to the subclass Neornithes, and inhabit ecosystems across the globe, from the Arctic to the Antarctic. Extant birds range in size from the 5 cm (2 in) Bee Hummingbird to the 2.75 m (9 ft) Ostrich. The fossil record indicates that birds emerged within theropod dinosaurs during the Jurassic period, around 160 million years (Ma) ago. Paleontologists regard birds as the only clade of dinosaurs to have survived the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event 65.5 Ma (million years) ago. Modern birds are characterised by feathers, a beak with no teeth, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a lightweight but strong skeleton. All living species of birds have wings; the most recent species without wings was the moa, which is generally considered to have become extinct in the 16th century. Wings are evolved forelimbs, and most bird species can fly. Flightless birds include ratites, penguins, and a number of diverse endemic island species. Birds also have unique digestive and respiratory systems that are highly adapted for flight. Some birds, especially corvids and parrots, are among the most intelligent animal species; a number of bird species have been observed manufacturing and using tools, and many social species exhibit cultural transmission of knowledge across generations. Many species undertake long distance annual migrations, and many more perform shorter irregular movements. Birds are social; they communicate using visual signals and through calls and songs, and participate in social behaviours, including cooperative breeding and hunting, flocking, and mobbing of predators. The vast majority of bird species are socially monogamous, usually for one breeding season at a time, sometimes for years, but rarely for life. Other species have polygynous ("many females") or, rarely, polyandrous ("many males") breeding systems. Eggs are usually laid in a nest and incubated by the parents. Most birds have an extended period of parental care after hatching. Many species are of economic importance, mostly as sources of food acquired through hunting or farming. Some species, particularly songbirds and parrots, are popular as pets. Other uses include the harvesting of guano (droppings) for use as a fertiliser. Birds figure prominently in all aspects of human culture from religion to poetry to popular music. About 120–130 species have become extinct as a result of human activity since the 17th century, and hundreds more before then. Currently about 1,200 species of birds are threatened with extinction by human activities, though efforts are underway to protect them.&lt;br /&gt;

        I solved this one last night and came here today (this was my plan B) to sign the log.  There was a sheriff at GZ who greeted us and warned us that sometimes there is suspicious activity in this area at night and there is usually "non-family friendly stuff" lying around (as he pointed to the pregnancy test not even 10 feet from us on the ground).  He just wanted us to be careful and watch where we step (he said there are lots of needles around).  He said most people come out here to watch the birds during the day, which made me chuckle because of the cache name.  I explained what we were doing (he had heard of geocaching but hasn't tried it) and my daughter showed him the cache after we found it.  Then the sheriff and my son had a nice talk about Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.  LOL!  Thanks for the fun puzzle!  And thanks for bringing us to this area!  I've never been here before!  :)

      D is for Double Transposition -
     </groundspeak:short_description>
     <groundspeak:long_description html="True">
      &lt;p&gt;In a columnar transposition, the message is written out in rows of a fixed length, and then read out again column by column, and the columns are chosen in some scrambled order. Both the width of the rows and the permutation of the columns are usually defined by a keyword. For example, the word &lt;tt&gt;ZEBRAS&lt;/tt&gt; is of length 6 (so the rows are of length 6), and the permutation is defined by the alphabetical order of the letters in the keyword. In this case, the order would be "6 3 2 4 1 5".&lt;/p&gt;
In a regular columnar transposition cipher, any spare spaces are filled with nulls; in an irregular columnar transposition cipher, the spaces are left blank. Finally, the message is read off in columns, in the order specified by the keyword.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A single columnar transposition could be attacked by guessing possible column lengths, writing the message out in its columns (but in the wrong order, as the key is not yet known), and then looking for possible anagrams. Thus to make it stronger, a double transposition was often used. This is simply a columnar transposition applied twice. The same key can be used for both transpositions, or two different keys can be used.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This is a series of caches all being letterboxes, none of the hides are tough, just look in the obvious locations. Any of the micro sized containers, will not contain an ink pad, so please bring your own if you chose to stamp. Do not take the stamp or the pad, they must stay in the container. &lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;

        I've had this solved for some time now and here I am in the area.  Had to come find it.  Started the day with a Christmas event in Grand Island, for a potluck and a unique gift exchange.  Cached a little then headed home.  Thanks, bjmccacher, for placing this cache!  No hides, no finds.  Much appreciate your efforts.

        On a mega caching run for a week with Axmantis, Quadrays, KUPChemist and me. QW was responsible for most the puzzle solving, KUP anything to do when math, and AX had the LBs and WIGs. I, on the other hand, was the TOTT and Physical guy. I don't have the cerebral bandwidth for the puzzles or the patience. 

This one was on the solve list once we got there, and yours truly went up and got it.

        I was out with bjmccacher and carnigrewal for the day and this cache was on the list.  BJ dropped us off as close as he could get us to GZ but made Carni and me walk by ourselves the rest of the way.  The terrain could've been better, could've been worse.  LOL!  Awesome GZ though!  We made the find quicker than we thought we would!  Thanks so much for bringing us here!  :)

&lt;font size="4" face="bloody" color="red"&gt;Welcome to the 7 Deadly Sins. Study these and prepare yourself, that way you are ready for what you are about to see while searching for these caches: Greed, Lust, Envy, Pride, Gluttony, Wrath, and Sloth. These caches were placed with the 7 sins in mind and hopefully you can appreciate the hard work that was put into these hides. We request that those of you that find these caches remain discreet and do not give away anything to future seekers. Please allow the CO's to help anyone that may need help. This will allow all cachers to enjoy the challenges that these caches provide, and the containers of the 7 Deadly Sins Series.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Description:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Greed (Latin, avaritia), also known as avarice, cupidity or covetousness, is the inordinate desire to possess wealth, goods, or objects of abstract value with the intention to keep it for one's self, far beyond the dictates of basic survival and comfort. It is applied to a markedly high desire for and pursuit of wealth, status, and power.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Start at the posted coordinates, find the clues that were left for you, and work your way to the final.&lt;br /&gt;

I appreciate you hiding and maintaining DGS - 7 DEADLY SINS - GREED.

This was a fun cache that brought me back down memory lane to a location where I found one of my first caches in the lincoln area, before i met so many fun people in the area who love this hobby as much as i do.  Thanks for the fun cache, the trip, and the fizzy grid filler! I cant wait to finish the series! Eventually!

      This cache is NOT located at the posted coordinates. To get the
actual coordinates you will need to solve the puzzle below. Once
solved you will be looking for a camouflaged micro size container.
It might be a good idea to bring a tweezers (or something similar)

      &lt;pre&gt;
A &lt;b&gt;cryptogram&lt;/b&gt; is a type of puzzle that consists of a short piece of encrypted text. Generally the cipher used to encrypt the text is simple enough that cryptogram can be solved by hand. Frequently used are substitution ciphers where each letter is replaced by a different letter or number. To solve the puzzle, one must recover the original lettering. Though once used in more serious applications, they are now mainly printed for entertainment in newspapers and magazines.

&lt;span&gt;This is a series of caches all being letterboxes, none of the hides are tough, just look in the obvious locations. Any of the micro sized containers, will not contain an ink pad, so please bring your own if you choose to stamp. Do not take the stamp or the pay, they must stay in the container.&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;The Knights Templar were a monastic military order founded in
Jerusalem in 1118 C.E. Their original mission was to guide and
protect Christian pilgrims along the path from Europe to Jerusalem
during the Crusades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through this mission, the Templars developed a banking system to
protect the finances of the traveling pilgrims, then expanded this
system throughout their holdings in Europe. Over time, France's
Philip IV of France amassed a debt to the Knights Templar for years
of service. He had nearly depleted his money due to his ongoing
battles with England. King Phillip became envious of the Knights
Templar and their rise to power, so he set his sights on their
famed fortunes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philip devised a plan to arrest all the Knights Templar and
charge them with crimes so devastating that no person or group
would come to their defense. The charges against them were
religious in nature and backed by the papacy of the Vatican and
Pope Clement V. His plan had to be swift and carefully put together
so as to not alert the Templars in advance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;King Phillip's orders were sent a month in advance to the King's
Men and other Bailiffs. They were not to be opened till dawn on
Friday, October 13, 1307. The charges against the Templars were of
the highest accusations of heresy: that the Knights Templar asked
members to spit on the cross and step on it, to deny Christ, to
perform homosexual acts, and so on. The king's orders were to
engage and arrest every Templar in France. All Templar outposts,
homes, wineries, mills, and castles were to be taken in the name of
the King of France and Pope Clement V.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This nationwide arrest was widely successful, and medieval
torture tactics were used to obtain confessions from the Knights.
This single act against the Templar Order is now viewed as one of
the most unlucky days in History - Friday the 13th. King Phillip
attempted to further bury the Templars in a public manner: a large
event in front of the Notre Dame Cathedral would have Templar Grand
Master Jacques De Molay publicly admit guilt of heresy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, the defeated grandmaster took to his forum and
apolgized to the people and Templar Knights for his weakness and
for signing forced confessions. He then rescinded his original
confession and testified to the public that he, his men, and all
Templar Knights were innocent, despite their forced confessions. An
embarrassed King Phillip was enraged by the old man's actions and
had him burned at the stake along with his second-in-command.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;De Molay's dying last words were to curse King Phillip and Pope
Clement V, claiming that by the year's end they both would meet
their demise. To add to the superstition of the Friday the 13th and
to the power of the Templars both men did die that year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, the secret diary of Grand Master Jacques De Molay has
been discovered. A strange entry was penned the day before he, and
all the other Knights Templar, were arrested. Perhaps you can
decipher its meaning?&lt;/p&gt;

        Happy to get this one with a Fantastic Team...
And it's a good thing because even having my hand held the whole way through figuring out this puzzle I still don't understand how it works.
But then again I am not the sharpest pencil in the drawer.
Love the history lesson.

        We had a list of possible ways to solve this cache &amp; had tried them all when we were told one of the methods we used should've worked but hadn't.  Went through them again &amp; again before contacting a couple local players who also needed this cache.  Most hadn't been the solvers so couldn't advise on the puzzle, &amp; those who could solve it mentioned trouble with the actual find.  Evidently, this is a cache that enjoys its solitary existence.  We finally got the methods worked out &amp; made it to GZ, where we found a mouse, spiders, mosquitoes (in October, oy), lots of barkoflauge, a tantalizing hole or 2, but no cache. Came back later with a hint from the CO explaining we needed to expand our GZ what turned out to be about 20 ft (in a place like this that makes quite the difference).  Another mouse went scurrying up next to J then disappeared outta sight.  We didn't actually expect the cache where we found it, so when we adjusted a few things we moved our hands back expecting more mice to scamper out.  Instead, we found the container replaced a few days earlier by the CO.  Giving a fave point because we thought the final location was fairly interesting &amp; a little bit on the creepy side.

      As with time, the Sudoku puzzles have changed.  For those of you who loved the Caesar Sudoku comes a new varient of the puzzle.  Behold the great journey ahead.  While Caesar saw the puzzle used in Caesar's Sudoku, he never saw the true works that Cato had for him.  Can you solve the puzzle before the next full moon?  Cato always was the type to create some of the best puzzles.  Behold the great Caesar's revenge, brought to you by a Nebraskache cacher near you!  And approved by your very own Local Cache Reviewer!

        foundit!  This one took a while for me to solve!  Finally found the solution and after going to the Gym in Havelock for a little workout I headed east to see if I was correct.  Found a vehicle parked at trail head with a trackable decal on it.  Found the cache and then moseyed down the trail to see who else was geocaching here.  Turned out to be Hallilily, who was visiting the area and finding a few.  He had found this one previously, so visited a bit and continued on.

        Fun find!  While out night caching with HuntinTrea$ure and VWphreak we decided to go after this one.  We had to go back to the car for a TOTT because we forgot the terrain rating until we spotted the cache.  LOL!  HT$ made the grab.  Thanks for bringing us here!  Cute cache!  :)

&lt;div class="UserSuppliedContent"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is one of a series of caches in tribute to the local cachers that help promote and support the hobby of geocaching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;div style="margin-left:2em;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;For BJMcCacher's contribution to the geocaching community and support of geocaching I have created this cache in his honor. He has placed many caches around the area. I would recommend getting some of those before getting this cache to understand his style of cache placement. I have placed this cache in typical BJMcCacher style. It is a 3 stage multi that will require some simple math and probably a tott.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Stage 1: You will find yourself looking at a green transportation vehicle. On the side will be 5 large numbers in white. Those will be A, B, C, D, and E.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
To get Stage 2 coordinates solve the following equation:&lt;br /&gt;
N40 (D+E) A . B (A+B+C+D+E) (B+D+E)&lt;br /&gt;
W96 (A+B) (B+D) . ((D*E)+B+C) ((D*D)-E) ((D*B)+A+E)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Stage 2: No math involved. It will take you to stage 3.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

        Greetings,

 We are doing a check of caches that have been disabled for an extended period. Please maintain this cache and post an appropriate note to the cache page. 

As stated in the cache listing guidelines [https://www.geocaching.com/about/guidelines.aspx#listingmaintenance](https://www.geocaching.com/about/guidelines.aspx#listingmaintenance) *You may temporarily disable your cache to let others know not to hunt for it until you have a chance to fix the problem. This feature is to allow you a reasonable time - **normally a few weeks** - in which to arrange a visit to your cache. In the event that a cache is not being properly maintained, or has been temporarily disabled for an extended period of time, we may archive or transfer the listing.*

**PLEASE NOTE:**
**Today's notice is a friendly reminder only. Do not reply to me directly.** Rather, please **LOG A VISIT on this cache page and WRITE A NOTE** with a status update and any intention to revive the cache. Several reviewers participate in cache maintenance tasks so a log posted in this manner is the best way to get your message seen. Without a log posted you risk having the cache archived.

If you have disabled this cache for the winter or a season, please consider this a reminder to post a notice for when you expect the area to re-open. Re-activate the cache if the area is actually open again.

After you have checked on it and it's ready for seeking again, great! You can re-enable the cache page  [http://support.groundspeak.com/index.php?pg=kb.page&amp;id=235](http://support.groundspeak.com/index.php?pg=kb.page&amp;id=235) by clicking the link under the cache name or by checking the box that says the cache is active. That will place it back in the review queue. You may also drop me a note and let me know the GC waypoint number of the cache or better yet, the URL of the cache page. If, however, you discover that the cache is missing and/or you decide not to replace it, then please remove any remaining pieces of it and archive it. This will open up the area for other geocachers to hide their own geocaches. You may also need to digitally relocate any trackable items still listed here.   If a "Needs Maintenance" log was posted, you will also need to log an "Owner Maintenance" log to clear the "Needs Maintenance" icon from the geocache page. [http://support.groundspeak.com/index.php?pg=kb.page&amp;id=404](http://support.groundspeak.com/index.php?pg=kb.page&amp;id=404)

I want to thank you for the time that you have taken to contribute to geocaching in the past and I am looking forward to seeing your cache up and running in the future. If the cache is not maintained or the status is not updated, it will be archived. Thank you for understanding.

If this sounds like an automated email template, that's because it is. I apologize for that but the volume of messages we get is such that templates like this make the process much more efficient. Thanks for your understanding.

I look forward to hearing from you.  Do not reply to this email. It is sent by a no-reply mailbot so I won't get it. **To respond, please do NOT send me an e-mail or a message center conversation as they lack needed functionality for reviewing. Leave a new "Reviewer Note" log here on your cache page.** If you're not familiar with this process, see the instructions [http://support.groundspeak.com/index.php?pg=kb.page&amp;id=81](http://support.groundspeak.com/index.php?pg=kb.page&amp;id=81).   I have your cache on my watchlist, and I will receive a notification when you write your note.  All reviewer notes are deleted when your cache is published.  

Additionally, please note that if I've not heard from you in 30 days, I will be forced to archive this cache. Don't let your cache get archived for non-communication  

Heartland Cacher
Your friendly Geocaching.com Reviewer

      The original (GCKPAY) went missing (just like Codee), and now this one is there to carry on the tradition.  Cache is a clear plastic container.  As of 5/3/2009 everything on the list was at the posted coordinates.
     </groundspeak:short_description>
     <groundspeak:long_description html="False">
      Here's what happened so far:

A strange lady named Doris from Blair Township (Upper Peninsula) Michigan gave you a 10 item shopping list [check out archived cache].  She usually rides her horse (Codee) to the store, but he was too weak from not getting his oats.  She claimed that you could find a treasure just using her list.  Well seems like everyone figured out the treasure, but forgot to get the groceries for Codee!  Now Codee is missing.  

Can YOU solve the new list, find the treasure, and figure out where Codee is?  Shop for each of these products IN ORDER.  

You do not need to buy anything--just find the product.  Here is a copy of her list, and good luck. 

Size------Product---------------------------------------------------------------Amount
42 oz	----Great Value Shortening----------------------------------------------7 cans
3.1 oz----Ivory Soap (3 pack)-------------------------------------------------8 packs
3 oz------Jell-O, Lime----------------------------------------------------------9 boxes
17.6 lb---Kibbles n’ Bits Original Savory beef &amp; chicken flavor--------------1 bag
3 lb-------Miracle-Gro, Organic Choice Blood Meal---------------------------3 bags
250 ml---Scope Mouthwash, Classic Mint-------------------------------------1 bottle
50.4 oz---Purina Cat Chow Complete Formula-------------------------------7 bags
8 oz------Noxema Clean Moisture Deep Cleansing Cream-----------10 bottles
3 oz------Jell-O, Orange-------------------------------------------------------2 boxes
8 oz------Gorilla Wood Glue---------------------------------------------------3 bottles

If you figure out where Codee is let me know!

        We started out on the quest to seek a few caches..... this was found all beat up with a hole in the lid as described.  So I had a cache similar to the original and a dry log and the old wet log in its own baggie.  Yea another find!  Now for more fun!  TFTC!

      &lt;pre&gt;
We all hate them, but we are stuck with them!

To begin with, ticks don't fly, jump or blow around with the wind; these suspects are not ticks.  Ticks are slow and lumbering, while spiders are quick and nimble. They are small, very patient and amazing in their capacity to locate their host/prey.  Their purpose in life is only to propagate their species and unknowingly pass diseases to those hosts they feed on.  They don't feed often, but when they do, they can acquire disease agents form one host and pass it to another host at a later feeding.  Their sensory organs are complex and they can determine trace amounts of gases, such as carbon dioxide left by warm-blooded animals and man.  They can sense the potential host's presence from long distances and even select their ambush site based upon their ability to identify paths that are well traveled. 

Understanding the disease potential ticks threaten us with and having the capability to identify the basic tick group will help you present your systems or potential disease issues to your Doctor so that treatment can be initiated.

Although the number of tick species is in the hundreds, there are relatively few ticks that interact with mankind and domestic animals causing harm. While most ticks limit their host selection, others are opportunistic feeders and will feed on almost any accessible host. A tick, which feeds on a select host group, will move infective agents within that group. However, when a tick is a nonselective feeder, it can transmit disease agents from one host group to another. These nonselective ticks pose the largest threat of infection in man.

Ticks generally are not born with disease agents but rather acquire them during various feedings.  They then pass the disease on to other animals and mankind during subsequent feedings. When an infection moves from an animal host to a human it is called zoonosise.  Lyme disease, babiosisos, erlichiosious and tularemia are examples of such diseases.

Ticks have life cycles that involve three distinct life stages of development- larval (infant), nymph (immature) and adult (mature). The ticks known for the greatest quantity of disease infections are the Ixodes group. The group consists of many ticks but the ones of most concern are ixodes scapolarius, ixodes pacificus, ixodes damini, and ixodes ricionoiuse.

Most Common ticks found in Nebraska are: Lonestar, American Dog, and Blacklegged (Deer). 

Tips to avoiding Ticks:
1. Use a product with 20% Deet or higher on both skin and clothing.
2. Apply permethrin to clothing.
3. Wear light-colored clothing
4. Wear long pants with sneakers or hiking boots.
5. Outfit yourself in bug repellent apparel
6. Stay on the Trail as long as possible
7. Avoid tick-infested places when you can
8. Be Viligrant - do a daily tick check
9. Put your clothes in the dryer, and tumble them on high heat.
10. Check your pets and your kids before letting them loose in the house. 

&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is a series of caches all being letterboxes, none of the hides are tough, just look in the obvious locations. Some of the micro sized containers, do not contain an ink pad, so please bring your own if you choose to stamp. Do not take the stamp or ink pad, they must stay in the container.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

      Cache is not at the listed coordinates, but fairly close by. It is located in a very nice little cemetery near Raymond, NE. Please respect the cemetery, no night caching, no walking on graves, and please pick up any trash you find. CITO is always appreciated.
     </groundspeak:short_description>
     <groundspeak:long_description html="True">
      You will be visiting three different stones to retrieve some needed numbers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The listed coords will take you close to Angela Cuttlers, from here, write down the date she died.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Down the line, you will find Ruth and Leslie Sterns, take note of the date Ruth was born, also take note of the date Leslie was born and died.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Last stone is of David Keyzer, here you will need to retrieve the date he was born, and the date he passed away.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
To get the final coords, you will need to find the following information, 40 56 ABC and 96 46 DEF&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A = The month Angela was born.&lt;br /&gt;
B = The last digit of the year that David was born in.&lt;br /&gt;
C = The second number of the year that Ruth was born in.&lt;br /&gt;
D = The second number of the year Leslie passed away.&lt;br /&gt;
E = The last number of the day of the month that Leslie was born.&lt;br /&gt;
F = The day of the month that David passed away - 1&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
After you have all the numbers, go find the cache, you will be looking for a small camo'd pill bottle.&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;

      A &lt;b&gt;walking stick&lt;/b&gt; is a device used by many people to facilitate balancing while walking.
&lt;p&gt;Walking sticks come in many shapes and sizes, and can be sought by collectors. Some kinds of walking stick may be used by people with disabilities as a crutch. The walking stick has also historically been known to be used as a defensive or offensive weapon, and may conceal a knife or sword as in a swordstick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walking sticks, also known as trekking poles, pilgrim's staffs, hiking poles or hiking sticks, are used by hikers for a wide variety of purposes: to clear spider webs, or part thick bushes or grass obscuring the trail; as a support when going uphill or a brake when going downhill; as a balance point when crossing streams, swamps or other rough terrain; to feel for obstacles in the path; to test mud and puddles for depth; and as a defence against wild animals. A walking stick can be improvised from nearby felled wood. More ornate sticks are made for avid hikers, and are often adorned with small trinkets or medallions depicting "conquered" territory. Wood walking sticks are used for outdoor sports, healthy upper body exercise and even club, department and family memorials. They can be individually handcrafted from a number of woods, and may be personalised in many ways for the owner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A collector of walking sticks is termed a rabologist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span&gt;This is a series of caches all being letterboxes, none of the hides are tough, just look in the obvious locations. Any of the micro sized containers, will not contain an ink pad, so please bring your own if you chose to stamp. Do not take the stamp or the pad, they must stay in the container.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Inside every geocache, there must be a logbook or paper for the finder to sign. In geocaches of appropriate sizes, there will also be swag to trade. Swag is defined as "Stuff We All Get," and is basically little trinkets or prizes for finding the geocache. A geocaching rule encourages you to take what you want out of the cache, but then put something of equal or greater value in. Unfortunately, this does not always happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is a series of caches all being letterboxes, none of the hides are tough, just look in the obvious locations.

Do not take the stamp or ink pad, they must stay in the container.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Sad to say, this cache is smaller, and does not contain any swag, but I filled the other letterboxes in the series the best i could!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;My fiftieth cache had to be something special. Many geocachers (including Doogie Dog) had a hand in crafting this puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cache is NOT AT THE POSTED COORDINATES, although it looks to be a stinky place there in the middle of the feedlot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After some feedback, here's some important information to decode this cipher:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. This is a derivative of a book cipher, so you will need a key to decipher it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. The 16-digit NUMBER key is the first thing you see on this page. Use it one digit at a time!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. I did not use anything for punctuation or for spaces--you'll have to put them in where you see fit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. Everything needed is located within geocaching.com.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5. Use the hint to decipher the West coordinates and a obtain a helpful clue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;
     </groundspeak:long_description>
     <groundspeak:encoded_hints>
      After decoding the cipher, you are only half way there.  Here's a hint for the second half:  I jump from (0+A, 3+A, 5+A); (2-B, 0+B, 14-B); (3-C, 3*C, 2*C); (9-D, 12-D, 7-D); (9-E, 11-E, 13-E); (10-F, 11-F, 14-F); (10-G, 22-G, 13-G); (10-H, 15-H, 13-H); (1+I, 13-I, 14-I); (7-J, 10-J, 12-J); (9-K, 15-K, 10-K); (5-L, 12-L, 7-L).  Try counting the steps--one step is an 'A', 26 steps is a 'Z'.

      &lt;h4&gt;Cache location and parking&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache IS NOT at the listed coordinates. However, this would be a good place to park while looking for the cache. The hike isn’t too long and is on good terrain…unless it rains.&lt;/p&gt;
     </groundspeak:short_description>
     <groundspeak:long_description html="True">
      &lt;h4&gt;The Puzzle&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many types of puzzle caches out there. Challenge caches, various codes and/or ciphers, Sudoku puzzles, number fill-ins, numerous calculations and formulas, and many more. Hopefully, at least a few of our fellow geocachers will find this puzzle a little…punny (I mean funny).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;N ab cd.efg W hij kl.mno&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listed below are 15 puns based on book titles and authors. All you need to do is match the author to the book title. Once all the books and authors are matched up, plug the number (from the author list) into the appropriate space in the coordinates (using the letters from the book title).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;For Example:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the answer for book title “M” is “Justin Time (2)”, plug the number “2” into position “M” of the coordinates (N ab cd.efg W hij kl.2no). By the way...this is not the correct answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is a small water-proof container that shouldn’t be too difficult to spot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verify your guess using the link below. Good luck and we hope you have fun solving our third punny puzzle cache.&lt;/p&gt;

        foundit!  Nice day to be out and about.  I've had this one solved for awhile and today was the day to see if I was correct!  Got lucky and cache was in good shape.  Also spooked a small deer herd on my hike to the GZ.

      R&lt;b&gt;OT13&lt;/b&gt; ("&lt;b&gt;rotate by 13 places&lt;/b&gt;", sometimes hyphenated &lt;b&gt;ROT-13&lt;/b&gt;) is a simple letter substitution cipher that replaces a letter with the letter 13 letters after it in the alphabet. ROT13 is an example of the Caesar cipher, developed in ancient Rome.
&lt;p&gt;In the basic Latin alphabet, ROT13 is its own inverse; that is, to undo ROT13, the same algorithm is applied, so the same action can be used for encoding and decoding. The algorithm provides no cryptographic security, and is often cited as a canonical example of weak encryption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is a series of caches all being letterboxes, none of the hides are tough, just look in the obvious locations. Some of the micro sized containers, do not contain an ink pad, so please bring your own if you choose to stamp. Do not take the stamp or ink pad, they must stay in the container.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;

      The coordinates listed above are for a parking area near the cache. Real coordinates can be determined by solving the puzzle below. They will take you to a camouflaged ammo can. Your journey is at an end. Or is it?! Beware! It may be a good idea to budget a fair amount of time to finding the cache, even after solving the puzzle below. I would appreciate any feedback, especially about the difficulty rating.

      If you are having trouble with the ammo can, ponder the following riddle:
Dot your i's and cross your t's
is one of cursive's many keys.
When this rule is turned around, 
then the cache's treasure's found.
Do not try to dot your t's
if the treasure you will seize.

        Oh, well.  I bought a UV light several months ago, for the specific purpose of doing this cache.  Today, I went to the area of GZ and parked along N 98th Street.  I then went to the trunk area of my vehicle to get the UV light.  Hmmmm, where is it?  I must have left it at home in the garage.  Dummy me!

I proceeded to GZ and found the container there.  I proceeded to disassemble and reassemble the items at the GZ 1 coords.  I finally found the necessary information.  Nope, it was not in the last item.  I proceeded to GZ 2 and upon arriving, I saw the container.  I knew what was going to be inside the container.  Yep, I proceeded to disassemble and reassemble the items at the GZ 2 coords.  I finally found the necessary information.  Nope, it was not in the last item.  I proceeded to GZ 3 and upon arriving, I saw the container.  Egads, I hope that the items in this container are not like the other two containers or I won't make it home in time for dinner.  Fortunately for me, I did not encounter similar items at Stage 3.

SL as BRE.  TFTC and a fun time.  This one is a favorite.

        The walk to the cache was very pleasant today as the trail had very recently been mowed 6 – 10 feet back on each side.  This was a fun multi with a lot of eggs in that bucket.  On my way back to my car I met the CO, RBMAN, on the trail.  As we walked back, that was when I learned that I should have checked the Attributes before starting the search.  TFTC.  #5059.  SL.

     <groundspeak:long_description html="True">
      A lot of people use initials when writing logs, QEF is one not used much around here, but I needed something that began with the letter Q! What it stands for is &lt;strong&gt;Q&lt;/strong&gt;uick &lt;strong&gt;E&lt;/strong&gt;asy &lt;strong&gt;F&lt;/strong&gt;ind - which this one definitely should be!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is a series of caches all being letterboxes, none of the hides are tough, just look in the obvious locations. Some of the micro sized containers, do not contain an ink pad, so please bring your own if you choose to stamp. Do not take the stamp or ink pad, they must stay in the container.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;

        Its April Fool's day and what else but find some caches.  I had this one solved and decided it would be a good time to make the find before the spring and summer growth.  All quiet here.  There was a deer skeleton near where we parked, the ribs still sitting up, as if the deer was just laying on the ground.  Found with Roger Dodger and da_ewoks.   Thanks for the cache GeoBaggs

        04/01/2013  4:40:00 PM - Today is my M day so I needed to find it before I headed southwest to Lincoln end even further south to Beatrice for the event.

Found my M cache in a zip and I hit the highway to Lincoln. Met mr_ewok at a puzzle cache he solved and found that lickety split. Which was nice since he had to cache and dash back to work. I had some time to grab a few I wanted and a few I went to but it did not work out due to creepy muggles or other obstacles.

About 3 p.m. I met up with ladycache and rogerdodger. We caravaned around until it was time to go to the event. The event was pretty full and the hostesses were great. Had some great prizes go around and some funny stories shared.

After the event we went to see if jeb532 and ksmav had a luck with a hard cache in town. When we pulled up they were in their car getting ready to leave. We asked them if they wanted to stick around and give it another go. They were game and here we all go a trio of us in the tree like monkeys. In about 15 minutes we were successful.

&lt;font size="4" face="bloody" color="red"&gt;Welcome to the 7 Deadly Sins. Study these and prepare yourself, that way you are ready for what you are about to see while searching for these caches: Greed, Lust, Envy, Pride, Gluttony, Wrath, and Sloth. These caches were placed with the 7 sins in mind and hopefully you can appreciate the hard work that was put into these hides. We request that those of you that find these caches remain discreet and do not give away anything to future seekers. Please allow the CO's to help anyone that may need help. This will allow all cachers to enjoy the challenges that these caches provide, and the containers of the 7 Deadly Sins Series.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Description:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Sloth is defined as spiritual or emotional apathy, neglecting what God has spoken, and being physically and emotionally inactive. Sloth can also indicate a wasting due to lack of use, concerning a person, place, thing, skill, or intangible ideal that would require maintenance, refinement, or support to continue to exist.&lt;br /&gt;

     <groundspeak:long_description html="True">
      &lt;p&gt;A 16&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century French diplomat, Blaise de Vigenere, created a very simple cipher that is moderately difficult for any unintended parties to decipher. It is somewhat like a variable Caesar cipher, but the N changed with every letter. You would "encode" your message with a passphrase, and the letters of your passphrase would determine how each letter in the message would be encrypted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the exact opposite of a "Variant Beaufort." To do the variant, just "decode" your plain text to get the cipher text and "encode" the cipher text to get the plain text again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you wanted even more security, you can use two passphrases to create a keyed Vigenere cipher, just like the one that stumped cryptologists for years. Again, a pretty simple trick, but it can ensure that your message is even harder to crack&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span&gt;This is a series of caches all being letterboxes, none of the hides are tough, just look in the obvious locations. Any of the micro sized containers, will not contain an ink pad, so please bring your own if you chose to stamp. Do not take the stamp or the pad, they must stay in the container.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;

come I've put on a little weight. Well, I explained my love of pie,
and she put me on severe diet. She said tha no matter how much I
love pie, I should never consume more than 3,237,824 slices in a
lifetime. Furthermore, I needed to start a serious exercise program
that involved at least 30,836,677 sit ups to get rid of that

        I was finally able to solve this puzzle (with help of a fellow cacher). Today I went to GZ and found the cache. I was just barely able to sign the damp log. SL as BRE. TFTC. 

Bad news though. I found the container on the ground. The lid has been chewed on so the container is NO longer water tight. I placed the container directly above where I found it on the ground. 

I forgot about the hint when placing the container, but it is close to the CAN. 

This one deserves a favorite.

      I know everyone gets tired of finding caches under a light post, so this puzzle, teaches you some history about them.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The earliest lamps were used by Greek and Roman civilizations, where light primarily served the purpose of security, both to protect the wanderer from tripping over something on the path as well as keeping the potential robbers at bay. At that time oil lamps were used predominantly as they provided a long-lasting and moderate flame. The Romans had a word 'laternarius', which was a term for a slave responsible for lighting up the oil lamps in front of their villas. This task continued to be kept for a special person as far as up to Middle Ages where the so-called 'link boys' escorted people from one place to another through the murky winding streets of medieval towns.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Before incandescent lamps, candle lighting was employed in cities. The earliest lamps required that a lamplighter tour the town at dusk, lighting each of the lamps, but later designs employed ignition devices that would automatically strike the flame when the gas supply was activated. The earliest of such street lamps were built in the Arab Empire, especially in Córdoba, Spain, Cairo, Egypt, and Baghdad, Iraq ( around 1000 AD ). The first modern street lamps, which used kerosene, were introduced in Lviv in what was then the Austrian Empire in 1853.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The first electric street lighting employed arc lamps, initially the 'Electric candle', 'Jablotchkoff candle' or 'Yablochkov candle' developed by the Russian Pavel Yablochkov in 1875. This was a carbon arc lamp employing alternating current, which ensured that both electrodes were consumed at equal rates. Yablochkov candles were first used to light the Grands Magasins du Louvre, Paris where 80 were deployed—improvement which was one of the reasons why Paris earned its "City of Lights" nickname. Soon after, experimental arrays of arc lamps were used to light Holborn Viaduct and the Thames Embankment in London - the first electric street lighting in Britain. More than 4,000 were in use by 1881, though by then an improved differential arc lamp had been developed by Friedrich von Hefner-Alteneck of Siemens &amp;amp; Halske. The United States was quick in adopting arc lighting, and by 1890 over 130,000 were in operation in the US, commonly installed in exceptionally tall moonlight towers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The first street in the UK to be lit by electric light was Mosley Street, in Newcastle upon Tyne. The street was lit by Joseph Swan's incandescent lamp on the 3rd February, 1879. The first in the United States, and second overall, was the Public Square road system in Cleveland, Ohio, on April 29, 1879. Wabash, Indiana holds the title of being the third electrically lit city in the world, which took place on February 2, 1880. Four 3,000 candlepower Brush arc lamps suspended over the courthouse rendered the town square "as light as midday." Kimberley, South Africa, was the first city in the Southern Hemisphere and in Africa to have electric street lights - first lit on 1 September 1882 . In Latin America, San Jose, Costa Rica was the first city, the system was launched on August 9, 1884, with 25 lamps powered by a hydroelectric plant. Timişoara, in present-day Romania, was the first city in mainland Europe to have electric public lighting on the 12 of November 1884. 731 lamps were used. On 9 December 1882, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia was introduced to electricity by having a demonstration of using eight arc lights, erected along Queen Street. The power to supply these arc lights was taken from a 10 hp Crompton DC generator driven by a Robey steam engine in a small foundry in Adelaide Street and occupied by J. W. Sutton &amp;amp; Co. The lamps were erected on cast iron standards, 20 ft in height. In 1888 Tamworth, New South Wales, Australia became the first location in Australia to have electric street lighting, giving the city the title of "First City of Light". Arc lights had two major disadvantages. First, they emit an intense and harsh light which, although useful at industrial sites like dockyards, was discomforting in ordinary city streets. Second, they are maintenance-intensive, as carbon electrodes burn away swiftly. With the development of cheap, reliable and bright incandescent light bulbs at the end of the 19th century, arc lights passed out of use for street lighting, but remained in industrial use longer.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Incandescent lamps were primarily used for street lighting until the advent of high-intensity discharge lamps. They were often operated at high-voltage series circuits. Series circuits were popular since the higher voltage in these circuits produced more light per watt consumed. Furthermore, before the invention of photoelectric controls, a single switch or clock could control all the lights in an entire district.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
To avoid having the entire system go dark if a single lamp burned out, each street lamp was equipped with a device that ensured that the circuit would remain intact. Early series street lights were equipped with isolation transformers. That would allow current to pass across the transformer whether the bulb worked or not. Later the film cutout was invented. The film cutout was a small disk of insulating film that separated two contacts connected to the two wires leading to the lamp. If the lamp failed (an open circuit), the current through the string became zero, causing the voltage of the circuit (thousands of volts) to be imposed across the insulating film, penetrating it (see Ohm's law). In this way, the failed lamp was bypassed and power restored to the rest of the district. The street light circuit contained an automatic current regulator, preventing the current from increasing as lamps burned out, preserving the life of the remaining lamps. When the failed lamp was replaced, a new piece of film was installed, once again separating the contacts in the cutout. This system was recognizable by the large porcelain insulator separating the lamp and reflector from the mounting arm. This was necessary because the two contacts in the lamp's base may have operated at several thousand volts above ground/earth.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Today, street lighting commonly uses high-intensity discharge lamps, often HPS high pressure sodium lamps. Such lamps provide the greatest amount of photopic illumination for the least consumption of electricity. However, when scotopic/photopic light calculations are used, it can be seen how inappropriate HPS lamps are for night lighting. White light sources have been shown to double driver peripheral vision and increase driver brake reaction time at least 25%. When S/P light calculations are used, HPS lamp performance needs to be reduced by a minimum value of 75%. This is now a standard design criteria for Australian roads.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A study comparing metal halide and high-pressure sodium lamps showed that at equal photopic light levels, a street scene illuminated at night by a metal halide lighting system was reliably seen as brighter and safer than the same scene illuminated by a high pressure sodium system.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
New street lighting technologies, such as LED or induction lights, emit a white light that provides high levels of scotopic lumens allowing street lights with lower wattages and lower photopic lumens to replace existing street lights. However, there have been no formal specifications written around Photopic/Scotopic adjustments for different types of light sources, causing many municipalities and street departments to hold back on implementation of these new technologies until the standards are updated.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Photovoltaic-powered LED luminaires are gaining wider acceptance. Preliminary field tests show that some LED luminaires are energy-efficient and perform well in testing environments.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In 2007, the Civil Twilight Collective created a variant of the conventional LED streetlight, namely the Lunar-resonant streetlight. These lights increase or decrease the intensity of the streetlight according to the lunar light. This streetlight design thus reduces energy consumption as well as light pollution.&lt;br /&gt;

        Searched for this cache while doing a little business travel. The focus was nabbing a few more higher D/T finds, grabbing some challenge caches, and adding a few counties - all of course as time allowed. There were many more caches that caught my eye, but just wasn't enough time.

Feel confident about the coords, but couldn't come up with it.  Either completely missed the obvious or this one is missing.

      OK, so you've bested one monster.  Do you care to go back for a big second helping?

This is a follow-up challenge cache similar to Scylla or Charybdis? (GC21MDH).  In order to log this cache, you will need to face (and defeat) both monsters!  

To log a 'found it' for this challenge, you must find and log a 'found it' on 52 caches (twice A to Z).  That is A to Z using only multis and A to Z using only puzzle caches!  I've added my list as an example.

To prove your worth, just update your original list with the new caches.  I'll check to see that you have a total of 52 caches, two for each letter and one of each type (multi AND puzzle) for each letter to confirm your find.  Oh, and this one won't be the easiest cache to reach...

Good luck!

        I signed the log for this on 1 Feb 2014, when I was in the area "walking on water". I has taken until now to pick off the last two caches, Q &amp; V Mystery, to finally qualify. I needed Q &amp; V for another challenge cache in Iowa, which I signed this past Memorial Day weekend, so I figured it was time to push ahead and get these last two caches. And with that, I now qualify for this cache. The qualifications are in attached pictures.

      Welcome to "Challenge Lake". These series of caches are inspired by I Challenge You and "Challenge Alley" in Sacramento, California. Enjoy!  The cache is located at the posted coordinates.

      Some folks just like the traditional cache.  

A simple park and grab or an adventure through the wilderness, traditional caches come in all shapes, sizes, and flavors.

In order to log a 'found it' for this cache, you need to have reached the traditional milestone--1000 cache finds of the traditional cache type. 
To mark this milestone, find and sign this cache's log sheet.  

Congratulations, you now hold one of the highest degrees in Geocaching, with all of its rewards and responsibilities!

        This was a great walk to the tall grass. I took some looking for a place to cross the ditch. It had running water but eventually found a spot to jump over. We signed, stamped and left some treasures.

      This cache is at the posted location and involves a combination of ideas (some new and some I've seen at other caches).  My earlier cache hides were to fill some of the missing D/T's in the area, then I placed some challenges.  Now I'm focusing on putting out unique/entertaining hides.  Consider awarding it a favorite, even if it proves overly frustrating...  Hopefully you will find this geocache memorable, AND if you deem it in poor taste, I sincerely apologize.

Old George had many secrets, and this may be his last one.  Can you unlock the puzzle and find it?

        Found it but not without a bit of difficulty.  We were lacking the right TOTT, so we tried the piggy-back method with J, the heavy, taller one on top...which promptly toppled us both into the mud.  Traded places to get the more nimble LA into position, where she was able to make the grab...just barely.  Those look like some sort of alien signalling towers.  SL TFTC #1282

        Out for the day with halllilley.  It was supposed to be a day of urban caching, but, it turned into rural.  Made most of the finds very quickly.  Although the finds were easy, we took way to much time.  And you know why!!  :)  Thanks for the hide.  Fav point for the story.

        We happened upon this hide today on accident, but it was a lot of fun so we're glad it worked out that way. Due to one member of our party breaking a flip flop on stage 1, we drove from there to stage 2, to stage 3, and to stage 1 again. We let her hop on one foot for a while on the start of our adventure, but that isn't very lady like and we were soon in full out tea party mode. This was a great little multi - took a little finagling of TOTTS and exercising our brains but in the end it was all worth it!

        I was out caching today.  This is one of the caches that I found.  SL as BRE.  TFTC.

I found Stage 1 &amp; the coords for Stage 2.  I went to Stage 2.  Whoops.  I need to return to Stage 1.  Back to Stage 1 I went.  I went back to Stage 2 and found the coords for Stage 3.  Nope, I did not return to Stage 1.  I went to Stage 3.  Aha!  I have what I need to sign the log.  SL as BRE.  I returned to Stage 1.  All is well.

      Just another KRAYZEE, short, fun multi from the girlz. We have had a lot of fun throwing this together, mainly because it is a little devious and hilarious all at the same time. If you giggle and curse us we have accomplished our mission.

        It is a good thing I don't get to see my wife after doing this particular cache. She would be thinking I was somewhere I was not supposed to be. I better not come home with any $2 bills.
