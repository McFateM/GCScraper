&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The cache is not at the posted coordinates. The hides along the trail are a mix of easy and tough hides. Please make sure to pull all the way over or off the road where possible. Replace the hides exactly as you find them, to maintain the difficulty/terrain rating. Do not replace “missing” caches without contacting the cache owner. Feel free to email the cache owner via geocaching.com, I will reply as quickly as I can.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        Out on another mild fall day. It was a bit windy so really had to hang on to the log.  Ran into a variation of containers this time which made it interesting.  I visited the small very old and unmaintained cemetery.  Too bad someone doesn’t keep it up out of respect.  There was only one corn harvesting team in the field so didn’t have to worry about dodging equipment.  I got hooked up on a barbed wire fence – that was fun; NOT.  Fortunately did not rip any clothing or skin. This is my first geoart and unfortunately I am doing it in stages as I do not have full days to commit to it.

There was only one corn harvesting team in the field so didn’t have to worry about dodging equipment.  I got hooked up on a barbed wire fence – that was fun; NOT.  Fortunately did not rip any clothing or skin. This is my first geoart and unfortunately I am doing it in stages as I do not have full days to commit to it.

        Was on a month long geo trip from NY to NV and back. I was on the way back and had these figured out before leaving my city. Quite the series, took a bit to find them, got most but not all. Construction hampered a few of them. Enjoyed the country drive and all the finds. A few were probably a little under rated. Padding my NE finds on this geo mission. TFTC

Please make sure to pull all the way over or off the road where possible. Replace the hides exactly as you find them, to maintain the difficulty/terrain rating.

        Out on another mild fall day. It was a bit windy so really had to hang on to the log.  Ran into a variation of containers this time which made it interesting.  I visited the small very old and unmaintained cemetery.  Too bad someone doesn’t keep it up out of respect.  There was only one corn harvesting team in the field so didn’t have to worry about dodging equipment.  I got hooked up on a barbed wire fence – that was fun; NOT.  Fortunately did not rip any clothing or skin. This is my first geoart and unfortunately I am doing it in stages as I do not have full days to commit to it.

        Couldn’t ask for a better weather day at this time of the year in the Heartland.  It was 60 degrees!  Instead of putting up more outdoor Christmas lights &amp; decorations, I decided to hit the ribbon geo art.  Great day to be on the back roads as there was minimal activity and the wind was not factor with the dusty roads.  Hoping to finish this geo art this year if the weather holds out.  I’ve enjoyed each one and appreciate you for setting it up.  Thanks!

        Was on a month long geo trip from NY to NV and back. I was on the way back and had these figured out before leaving my city. Quite the series, took a bit to find them, got most but not all. Construction hampered a few of them. Enjoyed the country drive and all the finds. A few were probably a little under rated. Padding my NE finds on this geo mission. TFTC

        Couldn’t ask for a better weather day at this time of the year in the Heartland.  It was 60 degrees!  Instead of putting up more outdoor Christmas lights &amp; decorations, I decided to hit the ribbon geo art.  Great day to be on the back roads as there was minimal activity and the wind was not factor with the dusty roads.  Hoping to finish this geo art this year if the weather holds out.

        Was on a month long geo trip from NY to NV and back. I was on the way back and had these figured out before leaving my city. Quite the series, took a bit to find them, got most but not all. Construction hampered a few of them. Enjoyed the country drive and all the finds. A few were probably a little under rated. Padding my NE finds on this geo mission. TFTC

        Day two in Nebraska with fellow monkey Salz69. On today's agenda was the Ribbon geoart, the Cross geoart and the GCF geoart. It was a blistery cold and windy day, totally different from the day before. We had our goal and were determined to achieve it. 

The highlights of this day were that I reached my 30K milestone!!!!! Woo hoo!!!! We got most of the 3 geoarts.....finishing with 275 caches. We even ended early and had time for a celebratory dinner. 

Stamped all logs with team name Poo Flinging Monkeys or PFM for short. TFTC!!!

        We have had our eye on the Omaha are GeoArt for some time now, so fellow Poo Flinging Monkeys teammate !FIA! and I decided this weekend was the one- hit it before the snow flies!![:D][^] 
Today we focused on The Ribbon, GCF and the Cross....lofty goal, but we did it!! We were on a mission- !FIA! hit 30K and how fitting on puzzles SHE solved![:D][8D]. ....we EVEN got a few benchmarks, and were NOT being forced to!!!!! The Ribbon and the Cross for the most part great- the GCF series has mostly been reduced to baggies with log sheets- but hey, as long as thee is something to sign, right? [B)]
The weather was quite a bit cooler today than yesterday, but constant jumping in and out kept me pretty warm- of course not !FIA!, she's NEVER warm!![:P][}:)][V]

Things we learned today:
1) Post pictures on FaceBook- we did today and were informed that there was an old cache nearby - !FIA! needed that month for her double jasmer! 
2) don't stack your meds!
3) some people would rather explode than "go" outside...
4) dual heat controls in the rental car are a good thing... 
5) "Who touched it last" game can get pretty competitive when it comes to unwanted SWAG taken from a cache
6) bathroom breaks can be eliminated from the daily itinerary, apparently some people can "hold it" FOREVER!!! .....others don't need to, the world is their urinal
for the most part, everything was safe and sound and ready to be foundf [:D]

All logs were stamped with the Poo Flinging Monkeys team stamper. or initialed PFM to save room.[;)] 

All challenges that cannot be verified by my profile, virtuals and Earthcaches will be addressed as soon as possible by either myself of team members. Thanks for all your hard work! [:D]

This guy was in my flight pattern. Kudos to all the hiders for making this area a caching destination .......and feeding my addiction!

Please make sure to pull all the way over or off the road where possible. Replace the hides exactly as you find them, to maintain the difficulty/terrain rating. Do not replace “missing” caches without contacting the cache owner. Feel free to email the cache owner via geocaching.com, I will reply as quickly as I can.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Please make sure to pull all the way over or off the road where possible. Replace the hides exactly as you find them, to maintain the difficulty/terrain rating.

        Was on a month long geo trip from NY to NV and back. I was on the way back and had these figured out before leaving my city. Quite the series, took a bit to find them, got most but not all. Construction hampered a few of them. Enjoyed the country drive and all the finds. A few were probably a little under rated. Padding my NE finds on this geo mission. TFTC

        Had a great day trying to wrap up this ribbon. There were many farmers out driving equipment, checking on their cattle and wondering what I was doing.  Each time someone stopped I had just grabbed the cache and was sitting in my car planning my next stop.  It was nice to know that they were there if I needed them. Luckily it was has been dry as one of my paths today took me down a dirt road; not gravel, dirt. This is my first geoart – it will not be my last!  I really had a lot of fun!

        Had a great day trying to wrap up this ribbon. There were many farmers out driving equipment, checking on their cattle and wondering what I was doing.  Each time someone stopped I had just grabbed the cache and was sitting in my car planning my next stop.  It was nice to know that they were there if I needed them. Luckily it was has been dry as one of my paths today took me down a dirt road; not gravel, dirt. This is my first geoart – it will not be my last!  I really had a lot of fun!

        This was the last one we got on this road.  The farmer came up and told us we were trespassing.  It seems some past geocachers damaged his property.  We were unable to return the cache container and left with it.  I have contacted the CO.

        Had a great day trying to wrap up this ribbon. There were many farmers out driving equipment, checking on their cattle and wondering what I was doing.  Each time someone stopped I had just grabbed the cache and was sitting in my car planning my next stop.  It was nice to know that they were there if I needed them. Luckily it was has been dry as one of my paths today took me down a dirt road; not gravel, dirt. This is my first geoart – it will not be my last!  I really had a lot of fun!

        This one was taking me downwards - it did not look safe, besides being uncommon for these finds.  All bridge reflector signs had been replaced - maybe the cache went with the old sign?

Had a great day trying to wrap up this ribbon. There were many farmers out driving equipment, checking on their cattle and wondering what I was doing.  Each time someone stopped I had just grabbed the cache and was sitting in my car planning my next stop.  It was nice to know that they were there if I needed them. Luckily it was has been dry as one of my paths today took me down a dirt road; not gravel, dirt. This is my first geoart – it will not be my last!  I really had a lot of fun!

        Road grating being done on this road.  There were several trees down on the side where the coordinates took me.

Had a great day trying to wrap up this ribbon. There were many farmers out driving equipment, checking on their cattle and wondering what I was doing.  Each time someone stopped I had just grabbed the cache and was sitting in my car planning my next stop.  It was nice to know that they were there if I needed them. Luckily it was has been dry as one of my paths today took me down a dirt road; not gravel, dirt. This is my first geoart – it will not be my last!  I really had a lot of fun!

        Lots of dirt work on the road. We were where #35 should be but the area north to the top of the hill and south to the bottom of the hill has been cleared. We found #36 on the north side of the brush pile at the bottom of the hill (white/brown bottle zip tied to a branch on the north side of the pile) or that could of been #35 and it was pushed down the hill. We claimed it as #36. Bubba6

        Had a great day trying to wrap up this ribbon. There were many farmers out driving equipment, checking on their cattle and wondering what I was doing.  Each time someone stopped I had just grabbed the cache and was sitting in my car planning my next stop.  It was nice to know that they were there if I needed them. Luckily it was has been dry as one of my paths today took me down a dirt road; not gravel, dirt. This is my first geoart – it will not be my last!  I really had a lot of fun!

Please make sure to pull all the way over or off the road where possible. Replace the hides exactly as you find them, to maintain the difficulty/terrain rating.

        Yesterday we did the star and today we are trying to conquer the ribbon. It's warmer today than yesterday!  We were just talking about all that it takes to figure out placement to make the art. We are very appreciative of all the hard work!

        Had a great day trying to wrap up this ribbon. There were many farmers out driving equipment, checking on their cattle and wondering what I was doing.  Each time someone stopped I had just grabbed the cache and was sitting in my car planning my next stop.  It was nice to know that they were there if I needed them. Luckily it was has been dry as one of my paths today took me down a dirt road; not gravel, dirt. This is my first geoart – it will not be my last!  I really had a lot of fun!

        Had a great day trying to wrap up this ribbon. There were many farmers out driving equipment, checking on their cattle and wondering what I was doing.  Each time someone stopped I had just grabbed the cache and was sitting in my car planning my next stop.  It was nice to know that they were there if I needed them. Luckily it was has been dry as one of my paths today took me down a dirt road; not gravel, dirt. This is my first geoart – it will not be my last!  I really had a lot of fun!

        Had a great day trying to wrap up this ribbon. There were many farmers out driving equipment, checking on their cattle and wondering what I was doing.  Each time someone stopped I had just grabbed the cache and was sitting in my car planning my next stop.  It was nice to know that they were there if I needed them. Luckily it was has been dry as one of my paths today took me down a dirt road; not gravel, dirt. This is my first geoart – it will not be my last!  I really had a lot of fun!

        Had a great day trying to wrap up this ribbon. There were many farmers out driving equipment, checking on their cattle and wondering what I was doing.  Each time someone stopped I had just grabbed the cache and was sitting in my car planning my next stop.  It was nice to know that they were there if I needed them. Luckily it was has been dry as one of my paths today took me down a dirt road; not gravel, dirt. This is my first geoart – it will not be my last!  I really had a lot of fun!

        Was on a month long geo trip from NY to NV and back. I was on the way back and had these figured out before leaving my city. Quite the series, took a bit to find them, got most but not all. Construction hampered a few of them. Enjoyed the country drive and all the finds. A few were probably a little under rated. Padding my NE finds on this geo mission. TFTC

        Couldn’t ask for a better weather day at this time of the year in the Heartland.  It was 60 degrees!  Instead of putting up more outdoor Christmas lights &amp; decorations, I decided to hit the ribbon geo art.  Great day to be on the back roads as there was minimal activity and the wind was not factor with the dusty roads.  Hoping to finish this geo art this year if the weather holds out.  I’ve enjoyed each one and appreciate you for setting it up.  Thanks!

        Was on a month long geo trip from NY to NV and back. I was on the way back and had these figured out before leaving my city. Quite the series, took a bit to find them, got most but not all. Construction hampered a few of them. Enjoyed the country drive and all the finds. A few were probably a little under rated. Padding my NE finds on this geo mission. TFTC

        Yesterday we did the star and today we are trying to conquer the ribbon. It's warmer today than yesterday!  If My calculations are correct,  we're about 20 away from finishing the ribbon!

        Couldn’t ask for a better weather day at this time of the year in the Heartland.  It was 60 degrees!  Instead of putting up more outdoor Christmas lights &amp; decorations, I decided to hit the ribbon geo art.  Great day to be on the back roads as there was minimal activity and the wind was not factor with the dusty roads.  Hoping to finish this geo art this year if the weather holds out.  I’ve enjoyed each one and appreciate you for setting it up.  Thanks!

        Couldn’t ask for a better weather day at this time of the year in the Heartland.  It was 60 degrees!  Instead of putting up more outdoor Christmas lights &amp; decorations, I decided to hit the ribbon geo art.  Great day to be on the back roads as there was minimal activity and the wind was not factor with the dusty roads.  Hoping to finish this geo art this year if the weather holds out.  I’ve enjoyed each one and appreciate you for setting it up.  Thanks!

        Was on a month long geo trip from NY to NV and back. I was on the way back and had these figured out before leaving my city. Quite the series, took a bit to find them, got most but not all. Construction hampered a few of them. Enjoyed the country drive and all the finds. A few were probably a little under rated. Padding my NE finds on this geo mission. TFTC

        Greetings I'm Heartland Cacher, one of the volunteer reviewers for new caches submitted to Geocaching.com.

It has been a while since I first looked at this cache.  I can't find any recent responses from the Cache Owner about maintaining this cache which makes it appear the Cache Owner is either unwilling or unable to maintain the cache. **Cache maintenance includes listing maintenance including updating any changes to the text, updating coordinates, removing needs maintenance attributes and enabling the listing.**  The cache will be archived and removed from the active cache listings. 

Thanks for your understanding,
Heartland Cacher

        Greetings  I'm Heartland Cacher, one of  the volunteer reviewers for new caches submitted to Geocaching.com. 

This cache was brought to my attention by one or more of your fellow cachers that think this cache is missing and/or in need of maintenance.  I want to thank you for the time that you have taken to contribute to geocaching in the past and I am looking forward to seeing your cache up and running in the future.  I'm temporarily disabling it, to give the owner the opportunity to check on the cache, and repair it, if necessary. Cache maintenance includes listing maintenance including updating any changes to the text, updating coordinates, removing needs maintenance attributes and enabling the listing.  If the owner feels they will not be able to repair this in a timely manner, let me know, and I'll archive it. This will keep the cache from continually showing up in search lists. It can be enabled once you have made repairs.

When repairs to this cache are completed and it is time to enable your cache, it will be no problem. You can re-enable the cache page  [http://support.groundspeak.com/index.php?pg=kb.page&amp;id=235](http://support.groundspeak.com/index.php?pg=kb.page&amp;id=235) by clicking the link under the cache name or by checking the box that says the cache is active. You may also drop me a note and let me know the GC waypoint number of the cache or better yet, the URL of the cache page.   If a "Needs Maintenance" log was posted, you will also need to log an "Owner Maintenance" log to clear the "Needs Maintenance" icon from the geocache page. [http://support.groundspeak.com/index.php?pg=kb.page&amp;id=404](http://support.groundspeak.com/index.php?pg=kb.page&amp;id=404)

I look forward to hearing from you.  Do not reply to this email. It is sent by a no-reply mailbot so I won't get it. **To respond, please do NOT send me an e-mail or a message center conversation as they lack needed functionality for reviewing. Leave a new "Reviewer Note" log here on your cache page.** If you're not familiar with this process, see the instructions [https://www.geocaching.com/help/index.php?pg=kb.chapter&amp;id=97&amp;pgid=74](https://www.geocaching.com/help/index.php?pg=kb.chapter&amp;id=97&amp;pgid=74).  I have your cache on my watchlist, and I will receive a notification when you write your note.  All reviewer notes are deleted when your cache is published. 

Additionally, please note that if I've not heard from you in 30 days, I will be forced to archive this cache. Don't let your cache get archived for non-communication

Thanks for your understanding,
Heartland Cacher

        Couldn’t ask for a better weather day at this time of the year in the Heartland.  It was 60 degrees!  Instead of putting up more outdoor Christmas lights &amp; decorations, I decided to hit the ribbon geo art.  Great day to be on the back roads as there was minimal activity and the wind was not factor with the dusty roads.  Hoping to finish this geo art this year if the weather holds out.  I’ve enjoyed each one and appreciate you for setting it up.  Thanks!

        Was on a month long geo trip from NY to NV and back. I was on the way back and had these figured out before leaving my city. Quite the series, took a bit to find them, got most but not all. Construction hampered a few of them. Enjoyed the country drive and all the finds. A few were probably a little under rated. Padding my NE finds on this geo mission. TFTC

        Couldn’t ask for a better weather day at this time of the year in the Heartland.  It was 60 degrees!  Instead of putting up more outdoor Christmas lights &amp; decorations, I decided to hit the ribbon geo art.  Great day to be on the back roads as there was minimal activity and the wind was not factor with the dusty roads.  Hoping to finish this geo art this year if the weather holds out.  I’ve enjoyed each one and appreciate you for setting it up.  Thanks!

        Was on a month long geo trip from NY to NV and back. I was on the way back and had these figured out before leaving my city. Quite the series, took a bit to find them, got most but not all. Construction hampered a few of them. Enjoyed the country drive and all the finds. A few were probably a little under rated. Padding my NE finds on this geo mission. TFTC

        Couldn’t ask for a better weather day at this time of the year in the Heartland.  It was 60 degrees!  Instead of putting up more outdoor Christmas lights &amp; decorations, I decided to hit the ribbon geo art.  Great day to be on the back roads as there was minimal activity and the wind was not factor with the dusty roads.  Hoping to finish this geo art this year if the weather holds out.

        Couldn’t ask for a better weather day at this time of the year in the Heartland.  It was 60 degrees!  Instead of putting up more outdoor Christmas lights &amp; decorations, I decided to hit the ribbon geo art.  Great day to be on the back roads as there was minimal activity and the wind was not factor with the dusty roads.  Hoping to finish this geo art this year if the weather holds out.  I’ve enjoyed each one and appreciate you for setting it up.  Thanks!

        Was on a month long geo trip from NY to NV and back. I was on the way back and had these figured out before leaving my city. Quite the series, took a bit to find them, got most but not all. Construction hampered a few of them. Enjoyed the country drive and all the finds. A few were probably a little under rated. Padding my NE finds on this geo mission. TFTC

        Couldn’t ask for a better weather day at this time of the year in the Heartland.  It was 60 degrees!  Instead of putting up more outdoor Christmas lights &amp; decorations, I decided to hit the ribbon geo art.  Great day to be on the back roads as there was minimal activity and the wind was not factor with the dusty roads.  Hoping to finish this geo art this year if the weather holds out.

        Was on a month long geo trip from NY to NV and back. I was on the way back and had these figured out before leaving my city. Quite the series, took a bit to find them, got most but not all. Construction hampered a few of them. Enjoyed the country drive and all the finds. A few were probably a little under rated. Padding my NE finds on this geo mission. TFTC

        Couldn’t ask for a better weather day at this time of the year in the Heartland.  It was 60 degrees!  Instead of putting up more outdoor Christmas lights &amp; decorations, I decided to hit the ribbon geo art.  Great day to be on the back roads as there was minimal activity and the wind was not factor with the dusty roads.  Hoping to finish this geo art this year if the weather holds out.  I’ve enjoyed each one and appreciate you for setting it up.  Thanks!

        Was on a month long geo trip from NY to NV and back. I was on the way back and had these figured out before leaving my city. Quite the series, took a bit to find them, got most but not all. Construction hampered a few of them. Enjoyed the country drive and all the finds. A few were probably a little under rated. Padding my NE finds on this geo mission. TFTC

        Couldn’t ask for a better weather day at this time of the year in the Heartland.  It was 60 degrees!  Instead of putting up more outdoor Christmas lights &amp; decorations, I decided to hit the ribbon geo art.  Great day to be on the back roads as there was minimal activity and the wind was not factor with the dusty roads.  Hoping to finish this geo art this year if the weather holds out.  I’ve enjoyed each one and appreciate you for setting it up.  Thanks!

        Was on a month long geo trip from NY to NV and back. I was on the way back and had these figured out before leaving my city. Quite the series, took a bit to find them, got most but not all. Construction hampered a few of them. Enjoyed the country drive and all the finds. A few were probably a little under rated. Padding my NE finds on this geo mission. TFTC

        Couldn’t ask for a better weather day at this time of the year in the Heartland.  It was 60 degrees!  Instead of putting up more outdoor Christmas lights &amp; decorations, I decided to hit the ribbon geo art.  Great day to be on the back roads as there was minimal activity and the wind was not factor with the dusty roads.  Hoping to finish this geo art this year if the weather holds out.  I’ve enjoyed each one and appreciate you for setting it up.  Thanks!

        Day two in Nebraska with fellow monkey Salz69. On today's agenda was the Ribbon geoart, the Cross geoart and the GCF geoart. It was a blistery cold and windy day, totally different from the day before. We had our goal and were determined to achieve it. 

The highlights of this day were that I reached my 30K milestone!!!!! Woo hoo!!!! We got most of the 3 geoarts.....finishing with 275 caches. We even ended early and had time for a celebratory dinner. 

Stamped all logs with team name Poo Flinging Monkeys or PFM for short. TFTC!!!

        Had a great day trying to wrap up this ribbon. There were many farmers out driving equipment, checking on their cattle and wondering what I was doing.  Each time someone stopped I had just grabbed the cache and was sitting in my car planning my next stop.  It was nice to know that they were there if I needed them. Luckily it was has been dry as one of my paths today took me down a dirt road; not gravel, dirt. This is my first geoart – it will not be my last!  I really had a lot of fun!

        Couldn’t ask for a better weather day at this time of the year in the Heartland.  It was 60 degrees!  Instead of putting up more outdoor Christmas lights &amp; decorations, I decided to hit the ribbon geo art.  Great day to be on the back roads as there was minimal activity and the wind was not factor with the dusty roads.  Hoping to finish this geo art this year if the weather holds out.  I’ve enjoyed each one and appreciate you for setting it up.  Thanks!

        Was on a month long geo trip from NY to NV and back. I was on the way back and had these figured out before leaving my city. Quite the series, took a bit to find them, got most but not all. Construction hampered a few of them. Enjoyed the country drive and all the finds. A few were probably a little under rated. Padding my NE finds on this geo mission. TFTC

        Yesterday we did the star and today we are trying to conquer the ribbon. It's warmer today than yesterday! Looks like they're working on the roads around here. The sign was down but the cache  was still there. Move the cache 25 ft North next to the orange marker.

        Couldn’t ask for a better weather day at this time of the year in the Heartland.  It was 60 degrees!  Instead of putting up more outdoor Christmas lights &amp; decorations, I decided to hit the ribbon geo art.  Great day to be on the back roads as there was minimal activity and the wind was not factor with the dusty roads.  Hoping to finish this geo art this year if the weather holds out.  I’ve enjoyed each one and appreciate you for setting it up.  Thanks!

        Was on a month long geo trip from NY to NV and back. I was on the way back and had these figured out before leaving my city. Quite the series, took a bit to find them, got most but not all. Construction hampered a few of them. Enjoyed the country drive and all the finds. A few were probably a little under rated. Padding my NE finds on this geo mission. TFTC

        Was on a month long geo trip from NY to NV and back. I was on the way back and had these figured out before leaving my city. Quite the series, took a bit to find them, got most but not all. Construction hampered a few of them. Enjoyed the country drive and all the finds. A few were probably a little under rated. Padding my NE finds on this geo mission. TFTC

        Out on another mild fall day. It was a bit windy so really had to hang on to the log.  Ran into a variation of containers this time which made it interesting.  I visited the small very old and unmaintained cemetery.  Too bad someone doesn’t keep it up out of respect.  There was only one corn harvesting team in the field so didn’t have to worry about dodging equipment.  I got hooked up on a barbed wire fence – that was fun; NOT.  Fortunately did not rip any clothing or skin. This is my first geoart and unfortunately I am doing it in stages as I do not have full days to commit to it.

        Couldn’t ask for a better weather day at this time of the year in the Heartland.  It was 60 degrees!  Instead of putting up more outdoor Christmas lights &amp; decorations, I decided to hit the ribbon geo art.  Great day to be on the back roads as there was minimal activity and the wind was not factor with the dusty roads.  Hoping to finish this geo art this year if the weather holds out.  I’ve enjoyed each one and appreciate you for setting it up.  Thanks!

        Couldn’t ask for a better weather day at this time of the year in the Heartland.  It was 60 degrees!  Instead of putting up more outdoor Christmas lights &amp; decorations, I decided to hit the ribbon geo art.  Great day to be on the back roads as there was minimal activity and the wind was not factor with the dusty roads.  Hoping to finish this geo art this year if the weather holds out.  I’ve enjoyed each one and appreciate you for setting it up.  Thanks!

        Out on another mild fall day. It was a bit windy so really had to hang on to the log.  Ran into a variation of containers this time which made it interesting.  I visited the small very old and unmaintained cemetery.  Too bad someone doesn’t keep it up out of respect.  There was only one corn harvesting team in the field so didn’t have to worry about dodging equipment.  I got hooked up on a barbed wire fence – that was fun; NOT.  Fortunately did not rip any clothing or skin. This is my first geoart and unfortunately I am doing it in stages as I do not have full days to commit to it.

        Out on another mild fall day. It was a bit windy so really had to hang on to the log.  Ran into a variation of containers this time which made it interesting.  I visited the small very old and unmaintained cemetery.  Too bad someone doesn’t keep it up out of respect.  There was only one corn harvesting team in the field so didn’t have to worry about dodging equipment.  I got hooked up on a barbed wire fence – that was fun; NOT.  Fortunately did not rip any clothing or skin. This is my first geoart and unfortunately I am doing it in stages as I do not have full days to commit to it.

        Couldn’t ask for a better weather day at this time of the year in the Heartland.  It was 60 degrees!  Instead of putting up more outdoor Christmas lights &amp; decorations, I decided to hit the ribbon geo art.  Great day to be on the back roads as there was minimal activity and the wind was not factor with the dusty roads.  Hoping to finish this geo art this year if the weather holds out.  I’ve enjoyed each one and appreciate you for setting it up.  Thanks!

        Couldn’t ask for a better weather day at this time of the year in the Heartland.  It was 60 degrees!  Instead of putting up more outdoor Christmas lights &amp; decorations, I decided to hit the ribbon geo art.  Great day to be on the back roads as there was minimal activity and the wind was not factor with the dusty roads.  Hoping to finish this geo art this year if the weather holds out.  I’ve enjoyed each one and appreciate you for setting it up.  Thanks!

        Was on a month long geo trip from NY to NV and back. I was on the way back and had these figured out before leaving my city. Quite the series, took a bit to find them, got most but not all. Construction hampered a few of them. Enjoyed the country drive and all the finds. A few were probably a little under rated. Padding my NE finds on this geo mission. TFTC

        Out on another mild fall day. It was a bit windy so really had to hang on to the log.  Ran into a variation of containers this time which made it interesting.  I visited the small very old and unmaintained cemetery.  Too bad someone doesn’t keep it up out of respect.  There was only one corn harvesting team in the field so didn’t have to worry about dodging equipment.  I got hooked up on a barbed wire fence – that was fun; NOT.  Fortunately did not rip any clothing or skin. This is my first geoart and unfortunately I am doing it in stages as I do not have full days to commit to it.

        Yesterday we did the star and today we are trying to conquer the ribbon. It's warmer today than yesterday! Not sure if we figured this out wrong or if it's been moved,  but we found it using our geosense.

        Out on another mild fall day. It was a bit windy so really had to hang on to the log.  Ran into a variation of containers this time which made it interesting.  I visited the small very old and unmaintained cemetery.  Too bad someone doesn’t keep it up out of respect.

        We hale from East Tennessee, but we always make the trek out to MOGA.  Millasmommies12, Diggin' Up Bones, (Zug) and Shnelly, black•dot, TeamCwody, PuzzledLady, Vandy66, and others that I haven't yet learned to spell converged on Manhattan for a week of caching and fun.  Another fantastic success if you ask me, perfect weather, great caches, and good people all of these things contribute to an excellent MEGA event.  We cached from the 17th through the 24th the only thing we had an issue with were the vast quantities of ticks!!  I think I picked off 150 in one sitting, but after that one they weren't that bad.  I think we just stirred them up...  Thank you too all the people who placed and maintain these caches, all answers for earthcaches and virtuals were sent for, and all logs were signed, GSMM.  Thanks again!!

        Out on another mild fall day. It was a bit windy so really had to hang on to the log.  Ran into a variation of containers this time which made it interesting.  I visited the small very old and unmaintained cemetery.  Too bad someone doesn’t keep it up out of respect.  There was only one corn harvesting team in the field so didn’t have to worry about dodging equipment.  I got hooked up on a barbed wire fence – that was fun; NOT.  Fortunately did not rip any clothing or skin. This is my first geoart and unfortunately I am doing it in stages as I do not have full days to commit to it.

        Out on another mild fall day. It was a bit windy so really had to hang on to the log.  Ran into a variation of containers this time which made it interesting.  I visited the small very old and unmaintained cemetery.  Too bad someone doesn’t keep it up out of respect.  There was only one corn harvesting team in the field so didn’t have to worry about dodging equipment.  I got hooked up on a barbed wire fence – that was fun; NOT.  Fortunately did not rip any clothing or skin. This is my first geoart and unfortunately I am doing it in stages as I do not have full days to commit to it.

        Out on another mild fall day. It was a bit windy so really had to hang on to the log.  Ran into a variation of containers this time which made it interesting.  I visited the small very old and unmaintained cemetery.  Too bad someone doesn’t keep it up out of respect.  There was only one corn harvesting team in the field so didn’t have to worry about dodging equipment.  I got hooked up on a barbed wire fence – that was fun; NOT.  Fortunately did not rip any clothing or skin. This is my first geoart and unfortunately I am doing it in stages as I do not have full days to commit to it.

        Out on another mild fall day. It was a bit windy so really had to hang on to the log.  Ran into a variation of containers this time which made it interesting.  I visited the small very old and unmaintained cemetery.  Too bad someone doesn’t keep it up out of respect.  There was only one corn harvesting team in the field so didn’t have to worry about dodging equipment.  I got hooked up on a barbed wire fence – that was fun; NOT.  Fortunately did not rip any clothing or skin. This is my first geoart and unfortunately I am doing it in stages as I do not have full days to commit to it.

        Out on another mild fall day. It was a bit windy so really had to hang on to the log.  Ran into a variation of containers this time which made it interesting.  I visited the small very old and unmaintained cemetery.  Too bad someone doesn’t keep it up out of respect.  There was only one corn harvesting team in the field so didn’t have to worry about dodging equipment.  I got hooked up on a barbed wire fence – that was fun; NOT.  Fortunately did not rip any clothing or skin. This is my first geoart and unfortunately I am doing it in stages as I do not have full days to commit to it.

        Was on a month long geo trip from NY to NV and back. I was on the way back and had these figured out before leaving my city. Quite the series, took a bit to find them, got most but not all. Construction hampered a few of them. Enjoyed the country drive and all the finds. A few were probably a little under rated. Padding my NE finds on this geo mission. TFTC

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The cache is not at the posted coordinates. The hides along the trail are a mix of easy and tough hides. Please make sure to pull all the way over or off the road where possible. Replace the hides exactly as you find them, to maintain the difficulty/terrain rating. Do not replace “missing” caches without contacting the cache owner. Feel free to email the cache owner via geocaching.com, I will reply as quickly as I can.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        Yesterday we did the star and today we are trying to conquer the ribbon. It's warmer today than yesterday!  Great camo, looked over it twice.
